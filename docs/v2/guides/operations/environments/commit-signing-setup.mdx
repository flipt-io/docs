description: Step-by-step guide to configure GPG commit signing with GitHub and other Git providers
---

This guide will show you how to set up GPG commit signing for Flipt v2 to provide cryptographic verification of your configuration changes.

import V2Pro from "/snippets/v2-pro.mdx";

<V2Pro />

## Prerequisites

- [Flipt v2](/v2/quickstart)
- A Flipt v2 environment configured with [Git Sync](/v2/guides/operations/environments/git-sync)
- [Secrets management](/v2/configuration/secrets) configured
- A Flipt v2 Pro license or trial license

<Note>
  This guide uses GitHub as an example, but the process is similar for GitLab,
  Gitea, and other Git providers.
</Note>

## 1. Generate a GPG Key

If you don't have a GPG key, create one specifically for Flipt:

```bash
# Generate a new GPG key
gpg --full-generate-key

# Select RSA and RSA (default)
# Choose 4096 bits for maximum security
# Set expiration (recommended: 2 years)
# Enter details:
#   Real name: Flipt Bot
#   Email: flipt@yourcompany.com
#   Comment: Flipt configuration signing
```

## 2. Export the Private Key

Export your private key for storage in your secrets provider:

```bash
# Export private key (replace with your key ID)
gpg --export-secret-keys --armor flipt@yourcompany.com > flipt-signing-key.asc

# The key ID can be found with:
gpg --list-secret-keys flipt@yourcompany.com
```

## 3. Store Key in Secrets Provider

Store the private key securely using your configured secrets provider:

**Vault Example:**

```bash
vault kv put secret/flipt/signing-key private_key=@flipt-signing-key.asc
```

## 4. Upload Public Key to GitHub

1. Export your public key:

```bash
# Export public key
gpg --export --armor flipt@yourcompany.com > flipt-public-key.asc
```

2. Go to [GitHub Settings > SSH and GPG keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)
3. Click **"New GPG key"**
4. Copy and paste the contents of `flipt-public-key.asc`
5. Click **"Add GPG key"**

## 5. Configure Flipt

Add commit signing configuration to your Flipt configuration file:

```yaml
storage:
  default:
    signature:
      enabled: true
      type: "gpg"
      key_ref:
        provider: "vault" # Your secrets provider
        path: "flipt/signing-key" # Path to private key in secrets
        key: "private_key" # Key name within the secret
      name: "Flipt Bot" # Signer name
      email: "flipt@yourcompany.com" # Signer email
      key_id: "flipt@yourcompany.com" # GPG key identifier
```

## 6. Deploy and Start Flipt

Deploy your updated configuration and start or restart your Flipt server.

Flipt will now automatically sign all commits to your flag configuration repository.

## 7. Verify Commit Signing

After enabling signing, verify that new commits are being signed:

```bash
# Clone your flag repository
git clone https://github.com/company/flags.git
cd flags

# Check recent commits for signatures
git log --show-signature -5

# Look for GPG signature verification
git verify-commit HEAD
```

### GitHub Verification

On GitHub, signed commits will display:

- âœ… **Verified** badge next to the commit
- GPG key information when clicking the badge
- Signature details in the commit view

## Troubleshooting

### Commits Not Showing as Verified

If commits aren't showing as verified:

1. **Check public key upload**: Ensure the public key is added to your Git hosting service
2. **Verify email match**: The email in the GPG key must match the configured email
3. **Confirm key validity**: Ensure the GPG key hasn't expired
4. **Check key ID**: Verify the key_id matches your actual GPG key

### Common Issues

**Signing Failures**

```
Error: failed to sign commit: gpg key not found
```

- Verify the key exists in your secrets provider
- Check the key reference path and key name
- Ensure the secrets provider is accessible

**Key Loading Errors**

```
Error: failed to load GPG private key
```

- Verify secrets provider connectivity
- Check authentication credentials for your secrets provider
- Ensure the private key is in valid ASCII armored format

**Permission Errors**

```
Error: insufficient permissions to access secret
```

- Verify Flipt has the necessary permissions in your secrets provider
- Check authentication method configuration
- Review access policies for the signing key secret

### Debug Configuration

Enable debug logging to troubleshoot signing issues:

```yaml
log:
  level: "debug"
```

### Validation Commands

Test your GPG key setup:

```bash
# Check if GPG key can be loaded
gpg --import /path/to/private-key.asc

# Verify key information
gpg --list-secret-keys your-email@company.com

# Test signing
echo "test" | gpg --armor --sign --default-key your-email@company.com
```

## Conclusion

This guide showed how to configure GPG commit signing for Flipt v2 with GitHub. Your flag configuration changes will now be cryptographically signed, providing enhanced security and audit capabilities.

You can now use Flipt to manage your flags with verified commit signatures that prove the authenticity and integrity of your configuration changes.
