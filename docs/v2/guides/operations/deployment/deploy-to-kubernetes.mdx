## What You'll Learn

In this guide, you will learn how to deploy Flipt v2 to a local Kubernetes cluster (via [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)) using our official Helm chart. You'll also learn how to override the default Flipt v2 configuration by providing a `values.yaml` file.

By the end of this guide, we will have:

- 🚢 Created a Kind cluster locally using Docker
- 📦 Installed Flipt v2 into your cluster via Helm
- ⚙️ Configured Flipt v2 settings via a `values.yaml` file
- 🔄 Explored v2's Git-native storage capabilities

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed ([Download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop))
- Helm v3.x installed ([Installation guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/))
- Kind installed ([Installation guide](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/))

## Deploying Flipt v2

### 1. Create a Local Kubernetes Cluster Using Kind

First, we need to create a local Kubernetes cluster. We'll use [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) to accomplish this.

Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
kind create cluster --name flipt-v2
```

This command will create a new Kubernetes cluster named `flipt-v2`. Wait for the command to complete and ensure the cluster is correctly set up.

### 2. Add the Flipt Helm Repository

Next, we'll add the [Flipt Helm repository](https://helm.flipt.io/) which hosts the Flipt Helm charts. Run the following command:

```bash
helm repo add flipt https://helm.flipt.io/
```

After running this command, Helm will fetch shared information about the new repository.

### 3. Update Helm Repositories

To ensure that Helm has the latest information about the charts from the Flipt Helm repository, update the repositories:

```bash
helm repo update
```

### 4. Install Flipt v2 with Custom Configuration

Before installing Flipt v2, you can create a `values.yaml` file to customize the deployment according to your preferences.

<Note>
  Flipt v2 works out-of-the-box without any configuration using Git-native
  storage. However, you can customize various aspects of the deployment.
</Note>

Here's an example `values.yaml` file with some common v2 configurations:

```yaml
flipt:
  config:
    log:
      level: INFO
      encoding: json
    server:
      grpc_port: 9000
      http_port: 8080
    cors:
      enabled: true
      allowed_origins:
        - "http://localhost:3000"
        - "https://your-frontend-domain.com"
    ui:
      default_theme: dark
      topbar:
        color: "#7C3AED"
    meta:
      check_for_updates: false
      telemetry_enabled: false
    metrics:
      enabled: true
      exporter: prometheus
    storage:
      default:
        backend:
          type: memory
```

This example configures:

- Structured JSON logging at INFO level
- CORS support for frontend integration
- Custom UI theme and branding
- Disabled telemetry and update checks
- Prometheus metrics enabled
- Memory storage backend (default)

<Note>
  This example uses memory storage which works out-of-the-box without requiring
  a Git repository. For production use with Git-backed storage, see the [Git
  Storage guide](/v2/guides/operations/environments/git-sync) for setup details.
</Note>

You can adjust this file to include any configuration values you need based on the [v2 configuration documentation](/v2/configuration/overview).

Once you have your `values.yaml` file (or to use default settings), install Flipt v2 with Helm:

```bash
# Install with custom values
helm install flipt-v2 flipt/flipt-v2 -f values.yaml

# Or install with default settings
helm install flipt-v2 flipt/flipt-v2
```

<Note>
  Note the chart name is `flipt-v2`, not `flipt`. This is the dedicated chart
  for Flipt v2 which includes v2-specific configurations and defaults.

</Note>

This command installs the Flipt v2 Helm chart into your Kubernetes cluster using the configuration options specified in your `values.yaml` file merged with the default values from the chart.

### 5. Forward the Port to Access Flipt v2

After successfully installing Flipt v2 via the Helm chart, you should see instructions on how to access Flipt in your terminal. The instructions will look something like this:

```bash
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=flipt-v2,app.kubernetes.io/instance=flipt-v2" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")

export CONTAINER_PORT=$(kubectl get pod --namespace default $POD_NAME -o jsonpath="{.spec.containers[0].ports[0].containerPort}")

kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 8080:$CONTAINER_PORT
```

Execute the commands in your terminal to forward the port and access Flipt v2.

You should now be able to access Flipt v2 at `http://localhost:8080`.

### 6. Verify the Installation and Configuration

To ensure that Flipt v2 has been correctly deployed to your Kubernetes cluster, you can check the running pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

You should see the Flipt v2 pod in the list with a status of `Running`.

```console
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
flipt-v2-6d64f856d7-4l5qn    1/1     Running   0          32m
```

To verify that your configuration changes were applied, open the application in your browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and you should see the Flipt UI with the dark theme and custom topbar color:

## Flipt v2 Features in Kubernetes

### Git-Native Storage

Flipt v2's Git-native storage works seamlessly in Kubernetes environments. The deployed instance can:

- **Clone repositories**: Automatically clone and sync with your Git repository containing feature flag definitions
- **Work offline**: Continue serving flags even when the source Git repository is temporarily unavailable
- **Support multiple Git providers**: Works with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, Gitea, and other Git platforms

### Environment Support

Flipt v2 introduces environments that map to Git branches, allowing you to:

- Deploy multiple environments (dev/staging/prod) from different branches
- Use branch-based workflows for flag management
- Create merge proposals through the UI that generate Git pull requests

### Configuration Flexibility

The v2 Helm chart supports all v2 configuration options, including:

- **Storage backends**: Git, local filesystem, or hybrid approaches
- **Analytics**: Optional ClickHouse integration for advanced analytics
- **Authentication**: GitHub, OIDC, and other authentication methods
- **Authorization**: RBAC and policy-based access control

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed Flipt v2 to a local Kubernetes cluster using our Helm chart. You've also learned about v2's Git-native capabilities and configuration options.

You should be able to take the knowledge you've gained in this guide and deploy Flipt v2 to a real Kubernetes cluster.

### Production Considerations

For production deployments, consider:

- **Resource limits**: Set appropriate CPU and memory limits in your `values.yaml`
- **Persistent storage**: Configure persistent volumes if using local storage
- **High availability**: Deploy multiple replicas with appropriate anti-affinity rules
- **Security**: Enable authentication and configure RBAC policies
- **Monitoring**: Set up observability with metrics and distributed tracing
- **Backup**: Implement backup strategies for your Git repositories and any local data
