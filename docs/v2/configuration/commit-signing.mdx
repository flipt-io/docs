description: GPG commit signing for enhanced security and change verification
---

Flipt v2 supports GPG commit signing to provide cryptographic verification of configuration changes. This feature ensures the authenticity and integrity of your feature flag modifications, creating a verifiable audit trail for compliance and security purposes.

## Why Use Commit Signing?

GPG commit signing provides several important benefits:

- **Authenticity Verification**: Prove who made configuration changes with cryptographic signatures
- **Integrity Assurance**: Detect if commits have been tampered with after creation
- **Compliance Support**: Meet regulatory requirements for change management and audit trails
- **Trust Enhancement**: Team members can verify the source of feature flag changes
- **Non-repudiation**: Prevent disputes about who made specific changes

## How It Works

When commit signing is enabled, Flipt automatically signs all commits to your flag configuration repository with a GPG key.

These signatures can be verified by Git hosting services like GitHub, GitLab, and others, displaying a "Verified" badge next to signed commits.

## Prerequisites

Before enabling commit signing, ensure you have:

1. **Secrets Management Configured**: GPG keys are stored securely using [secrets management](/v2/configuration/secrets)
2. **GPG Key Pair**: A valid GPG private/public key pair for signing
3. **Flipt Pro License**: Commit signing is a Pro feature

<Note>
  For step-by-step instructions on setting up commit signing with GitHub and
  other Git providers, see the [Commit Signing Setup
  Guide](/v2/guides/operations/environments/commit-signing-setup).
</Note>

## Configuration

Configure commit signing in your Flipt configuration:

```yaml
storage:
  default:
    signature:
      enabled: true
      type: "gpg"
      key_ref:
        provider: "vault" # Your secrets provider
        path: "flipt/signing-key" # Path to private key in secrets
        key: "private_key" # Key name within the secret
      name: "Flipt Bot" # Signer name
      email: "flipt@yourcompany.com" # Signer email
      key_id: "flipt@yourcompany.com" # GPG key identifier
```
