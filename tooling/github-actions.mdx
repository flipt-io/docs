## Setup Flipt

![Flipt Setup Action](/v2/images/tooling/setup-action.png)

The [flipt-setup-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/flipt-setup-action) can be used to setup Flipt v1 in your GitHub workflow. Once setup, you can then use any of the [CLI commands](/cli/overview) that Flipt provides in your workflow.

### Usage

The following example demonstrates how to use the action in a GitHub workflow which runs the [flipt validate](/cli/commands/validate) command.

```yaml
validate:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - uses: flipt-io/setup-action@v0.5.0
      with:
        version: v1 # Installs the latest v1 release
      # Optional, additional arguments to pass to the `flipt` command
      # args:
      # Optional, the directory to run Flipt against, defaults to the repository root
      # working-directory:

    - run: flipt validate
```
