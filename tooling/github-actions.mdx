## Setup Flipt

![Flipt Setup Action](/images/tooling/setup-action.png)

The [flipt-setup-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/flipt-setup-action) can be used to setup Flipt in your GitHub workflow. Once setup, you can then use any of the [CLI commands](https://www.flipt.io/docs/cli/overview) that Flipt provides in your workflow.

### Usage

The following example demonstrates how to use the action in a GitHub workflow which runs the [flipt validate](https://www.flipt.io/docs/cli/commands/validate) command.

```yaml
validate:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - uses: flipt-io/setup-action@v0.1.0
      # with:
      # Optional, additional arguments to pass to the `flipt` command
      # args:
      # Optional, the version of Flipt to install, defaults to the latest release
      # version:
      # Optional, the directory to run Flipt against, defaults to the repository root
      # working-directory:

    - run: flipt validate
```

Other commands that may be useful to run in your workflows include:

- [flipt bundle](https://www.flipt.io/docs/cli/commands/bundle)
- [flipt export](https://www.flipt.io/docs/cli/commands/export)
- [flipt import](https://www.flipt.io/docs/cli/commands/import)
