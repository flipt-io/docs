## Validate

![Flipt Validate Action](/images/tooling/validate-action.png)

The [flipt-validate action](https://github.com/flipt-io/validate-action) is used to validate your [features.yml](/configuration/storage#flag-state-configuration) files in a GitHub workflow. We recommend to use this action in your workflow to ensure that your Flipt data is syntactically and semantically valid before deploying when using [Git](https://www.flipt.io/docs/configuration/storage#git) or other [declarative backends](https://www.flipt.io/docs/configuration/storage#declarative).

It uses the [`flipt validate`](/cli/commands/validate) command under the hood to validate your data. If the data is invalid, the action will fail and provide a detailed error annotation at the source of the error.

### Usage

The following example demonstrates how to use the action in a GitHub workflow.

```yaml
validate:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    # Checkout the target repository
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - uses: flipt-io/validate-action@v0.1.0
      # with:
      # Optional, the token to use for GitHub API requests
      # github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      # Optional, the directory to validate, defaults to the repository root
      # working-directory:
```
