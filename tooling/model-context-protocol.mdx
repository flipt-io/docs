title: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
description: Use Flipt's MCP server to enable AI assistants to interact with your feature flags
---

## Overview

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications - it provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

[Flipt's MCP server](https://github.com/flipt-io/mcp-server-flipt) allows AI assistants and LLMs to directly interact with your feature flags, segments, and evaluations through a standardized interface. This enables powerful AI-driven workflows and integrations with tools that support the MCP protocol.

## Use Cases

### AI-Enabled IDEs

When using AI-enabled IDEs like Cursor that support MCP, your AI assistant can:

- Check feature flag states while reviewing code
- Help toggle features on/off during development
- Assist in creating and managing feature flags
- Evaluate flags for specific users/entities
- Help debug feature flag logic and rules

For example, you could ask your AI assistant:

- "What's the current state of the 'dark-mode' flag?"
- "Enable the 'beta-features' flag for all users in the 'internal' segment"
- "Create a new feature flag for our upcoming notification system"

### AI Agents and Workflows

The Flipt MCP server can be integrated into broader AI agent workflows to:

- Automate feature flag management based on system metrics
- Coordinate feature rollouts across multiple services
- Generate reports on feature usage and impact
- Manage complex feature flag rules and segments

## Getting Started

Check out the [Flipt MCP server repository](https://github.com/flipt-io/mcp-server-flipt) for the most up to date information on how to use the MCP server.

### Cursor

To use the Flipt MCP server with Cursor, you need to configure Cursor to use the MCP server.

The Cursor docs have a [guide on how to configure Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#configuring-mcp-servers) to use a MCP server.

For Flipt, you can use the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flipt": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@flipt-io/mcp-server-flipt"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration

The server can be configured using environment variables:

```bash
# The URL of your Flipt instance
FLIPT_API_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Optional API key for authentication
FLIPT_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

## Available Operations

The Flipt MCP server provides tools for:

- **Namespace Management**: Create, list, update, and delete namespaces
- **Flag Operations**: Create, toggle, and manage feature flags
- **Segment Management**: Define and update user segments
- **Flag Evaluation**: Evaluate flags for specific entities
- **Constraints & Rules**: Manage targeting rules and constraints
- **Variants & Distributions**: Configure feature variants and rollout distributions
