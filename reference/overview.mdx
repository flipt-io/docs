title: API Overview
---

Flipt's API is the primary way to interact with Flipt outside of the UI. It's used to create, update, and delete entities such as namespaces, flags, segments, rules, and also to evaluate flags.

The Flipt UI is completely backed by this same API. This means that anything that can be done in the Flipt UI can also be done via the REST API.

The Flipt REST API can also be used with any language that can make HTTP requests.

The latest version of the REST API is fully documented using the [OpenAPI v3 specification](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt-openapi).

## SDKs

We're adding new SDKs all the time. To see the latest list of SDKs, head to the [REST SDKs](/integration/rest) documentation

## Authentication

<Info>
Flipt authentication is **disabled** (not required) by default.

Head to the [Configuration: Authentication](/configuration#authentication) section to enable it.

</Info>

Once enabled, the Flipt REST API uses tokens for authentication. The token is passed in the `Authorization` header of the request as a `Bearer` token.

For more information on how to create a token, see the [Authentication](/authentication) documentation.

## Backward Compatibility

We take great care to ensure that the Flipt REST API is backward compatible. This means that you can safely upgrade to a newer version of Flipt without having to change your API calls.

From time to time we may need to make large changes to the API as we introduce additional features, however we will continue to make sure that we preserve backward compatibility.

We will describe any major changes in the section below.

## API Changes

### v1.24.0

Version [v1.24.0](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/releases/tag/v1.24.0) of Flipt introduced the concept of [boolean flag types](/concepts#boolean-flags) as well as [Rollouts](/concepts#rollouts) to override a flag's `enabled` state via a set of rules.

We also introduced a new `/evaluate/v1` set of API endpoints to evaluate both `boolean` and `variant` flags. The previous `/api/v1/evaluate` endpoints for evaluation are still available and will continue to work as before, however they will only work for `variant` type flags and should be considered deprecated.

### v1.20.0

Version [v1.20.0](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/releases/tag/v1.20.0) of Flipt introduced the concept of [Namespaces](/concepts#namespaces) as root objects nested under the `/namespaces` route (i.e.: `/api/v1/namespace/{namespaceKey}/flags`).

All previous endpoints without the `/namespaces` prefix still work as before (i.e.: `/api/v1/flags`), they simply resolve to using the **default** namespace.

See the [Concepts: Namespaces](/concepts#namespaces) section for more information.
