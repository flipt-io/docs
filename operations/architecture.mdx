The Flipt application is made up of three main components:

- Flipt Backend Service
- Flipt REST API
- Flipt Web UI

All three of these components run side by side in a single binary. The UI and
REST API are served on the same port (`8080` by default) and the GRPC Backend
Service is served on `9000` by default.

## Backend

The Flipt Backend service is the main entry point to the application and
implements all of the business logic for Flipt. This is what users of the gRPC
client SDKs will communicate with, allowing for fast, efficient communication
with your applications.

### REST API

The Flipt REST API is implemented on top of the Backend Service using gRPC
Gateway (described below).

The REST API is served under `/api/v1` and allows all actions that the client
SDKs allow.

### Web UI

The Flipt Web UI is a modern, minimalist UI to allow you to easily set up and
monitor your feature flags and experiments. It's served as a JavaScript Single
Page Application (SPA) and communicates with the Flipt Backend Service through
the REST API.

A guide to using the UI for the first time can be found in the
[Getting Started](/introduction) documentation.

## Storage

Flipt can be run with a multitude of different databases and storage backends including non-traditional data stores like Git, OCI, S3, Azure, and Google Cloud Storage.

See our [Storage](/configuration/storage) documentation for more information on all of the available storage backends.

## Technologies

Flipt is built using several amazing open-source technologies including:

- [Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/)
- [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)
- [gRPC Gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/)
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### Go

From the [Go](https://golang.org/) documentation:

> Go makes it easy to build simple, reliable and efficient software.

These are all goals that Flipt also aspires to. Flipt was written in Go mainly
because of its ability to produce bulletproof systems software as a single
binary for multiple architectures.

This allows Flipt to easily be deployed in almost any environment since it's as
simple as copying a compiled binary.

### GRPC

[gRPC](https://grpc.io/) is a high-performance, open-source RPC framework
created by Google. gRPC allows Flipt to be performant by eliminating much of the
overhead incurred by using standard HTTP for communication.

gRPC also has the benefit of being able to generate client SDKs in many
different languages from a single
[Protobuf](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/blob/main/rpc/flipt/flipt.proto)
file.

This allows you easily integrate your services with Flipt regardless of the
language that they're written in.

### GRPC Gateway

While awesome, gRPC might not be for everyone.
[gRPC Gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/) is a
reverse-proxy server which translates a RESTful JSON API into gRPC. This allows
Flipt to implement a REST API as well as the gRPC API described above.

This means that the REST API follows the same code paths as the gRPC service that
Flipt implements, allowing for reduced bugs and a simpler architecture.

The Flipt UI is also built on top of the REST API provided by gRPC gateway.
