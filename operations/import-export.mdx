description: Importing and exporting data to and from Flipt
---

<Note>Importing is only supported for database backed Flipt instances.</Note>

Both `flipt import` and `flipt export` support the `--address` and `--token` flags to enable transferring data to and from Flipt instances via the API instead of requiring a direct database connection.

```
flipt import --address http://flipt.my.org --token static-api-token

flipt export --address grpc://flipt.my.org:9000
```

Both `HTTP` and `gRPC` are supported by the `--address` flag.

## Import

To import data into Flipt, use the `flipt import` command. You
can import either from a file or from STDIN.

To import from STDIN, Flipt requires the `--stdin` flag:

```yaml
cat flipt.yaml | flipt import --stdin
```

If not importing using `--stdin`, Flipt requires the file to be imported as an
argument:

```yaml
flipt import flipt.yaml
```

By default, Flipt will import into the `default` namespace.
Use the flag `--namespace` to import into a different namespace.

```yaml
flipt import --namespace production flipt.yaml
```

A namespace must exist before your import into it.
For convenience, you can supply `--create-namespace` in order for Flipt to automatically create the namespace if it doesn't already exist.

```yaml
flipt import --namespace production --create-namespace flipt.yaml
```

<Note>
  In [v1.28.0](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/releases/tag/v1.28.0), we introduced some breaking changes to `import`.

You no longer have to use the `--namespace` or `--create-namespace` flags to import resources into a specific namespace.

The namespaces are now inferred from the YAML documents themselves. If a namespace your document refers to does not exist in the database, it will be created.

</Note>

This command supports the `--drop` flag that will drop all data in your
Flipt database tables before importing. This is to ensure that no data
collisions occur during the import.

<Warning>
  Be careful when using the `--drop` flag as it will immediately drop all data
  and there is no undo. It's recommended to first backup your database before
  running this command just to be safe.
</Warning>

## Export

To export Flipt data, use the `flipt export` command.

By default, `export` will output to STDOUT:

```yaml
$ flipt export

flags:
- key: new-contact-page
  name: New Contact Page
  description: Show users our Beta contact page
  enabled: true
  variants:
  - key: blue
    name: Blue
  - key: green
    name: Green
```

You can also export to a file using the `-o filename` or `--output filename`
flags:

```yaml
flipt export -o flipt.yaml
```

By default, Flipt will export from the `default` namespace.
Use the flag `--namespace` to export from a different namespace.

```yaml
flipt export --namespace production
```

<Note>
  In [v1.28.0](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/releases/tag/v1.28.0), we have extended this functionality to support exporting state from multiple namespaces to a single YAML file.

  The `--namespace` flag is now deprecated.

  The `--namespaces` flag will accept a comma-delimited list of namespaces from which you would like to export from.

  The `--all-namespaces flag is a boolean flag that tells export to export all namespaces to the single file you specify, or to standard out by default.
