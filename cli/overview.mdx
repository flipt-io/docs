The `flipt` CLI is a command line interface for managing Flipt. It's useful for configuring your Flipt instance, running migrations, validating `.features.yml` files, and more.

You can use it in various environments, including your local machine, CI/CD, and more.

### Installation

<CodeGroup>
```console Homebrew
brew install flipt-io/brew/flipt
```

```console Binary
curl -fsSL https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/raw/main/install.sh | bash
```

</CodeGroup>

### Usage

```
flipt <command> <subcommand> [flags]
```

`flipt` with no arguments will run the Flipt server. It will look for a configuration file as described in the [configuration](/configuration/overview#configuration-file) documentation. You can specify a different configuration file with the `--config` flag.

### Examples

```
$ flipt
$ flipt config init
$ flipt --config /path/to/config.yml migrate
```

### Options

```
      --config string   path to config file
  -h, --help            help for flipt
```
