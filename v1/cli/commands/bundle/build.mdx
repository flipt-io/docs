```
flipt bundle build [flags] <name>
```

This command builds a new bundle containing feature files identified via Flipt's feature index (see: [Locating flag state](/configuration/storage#locating-flag-state)).

Given the files are all valid the command should successfully create a new (local) OCI feature bundle, and its resulting SHA digest is printed.

Bundles are named via the provided `name` argument. This argument supports an optional `tag` suffix.

### Examples

```
$ flipt bundle build mybundle
sha256:0e500a47bc26afcc91a1cea7abb39f55566bb99b709449a1752eea65000a663c

$ flipt bundle build mybundle:latest
sha256:0e500a47bc26afcc91a1cea7abb39f55566bb99b709449a1752eea65000a663c
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for build
```
