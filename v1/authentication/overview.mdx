description: This document describes how to enable and use authentication with Flipt.
---

Flipt supports the ability to secure its core API routes with authentication.

<Info>
Flipt authentication is **disabled** (not required) by default.

Head to the [Configuration: Authentication](/configuration/authentication) section to learn how to enable it.

</Info>

Once enabled, all routes beneath the following API prefixes will require a [client token](#client-tokens) or [JWT](#json-web-tokens) to authenticate requests:

- `/api/v1/`
- `/auth/v1/`
- `/meta/`
- `/evaluation/v1/`

<Warning>
The following URLs aren't protected by authentication:

- `/debug`
- `/metrics`
- `/health`

They're currently unprotected to support backward compatibility.

We're exploring ways to support protecting these endpoints going forward.
For now, we recommend excluding these API prefixes from your load-balancer.

</Warning>

Apart from `/auth/v1/` itself, the rest of the top-level API prefixes can be optionally excluded from authentication.
Allowing for sections, such as the evaluations API, to be publicly accessible while still protecting the management and metadata APIs.

See the [Configuration: Authentication Exclusions](/configuration/authentication#exclusions) documentation for details.

## Client Tokens

Client tokens are the core credential required to authenticate a request.
Tokens themselves are acquired via [authentication methods](/authentication/methods).

Flipt supports multiple authentication methods for acquiring credentials:

1. [Static Token](/authentication/methods/#static-token)
1. [OIDC](/authentication/methods/#oidc)
1. [GitHub](/authentication/methods/#github)
1. [Kubernetes](/authentication/methods/#kubernetes)

Once a `client token` has been acquired, it can be supplied via request metadata dependent on the protocol. Both HTTP and gRPC examples can be found on the [Using Client Tokens](/authentication/using-tokens) page.

## JSON Web Tokens

Flipt can also authenticate requests using externally created and signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/). This is useful for integrating existing authentication systems with Flipt.

To enable JWT authentication, you will need to configure Flipt with the public key used to verify the JWT signature.

See the [Configuration: JWT Authentication](/configuration/authentication#json-web-token) documentation for details.
