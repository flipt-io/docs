## Authentication

Flipt Hybrid Cloud supports multiple authentication methods, including email/password, Google, and GitHub. You can also use Single Sign-On (SSO) with providers like Okta, Microsoft Active Directory, and Google Workspace.

You get social login, passwordless authentication, and multi-factor authentication out of the box and for **free**. 

We also support custom authentication providers, so you can integrate with your existing identity management system.

This flexibility allows you to choose the authentication method that best fits your organization's needs, whether you're a small startup or a large enterprise.

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

Flipt Hybrid Cloud supports Single Sign-On (SSO) with popular identity providers like Okta, Microsoft Active Directory, and Google Workspace. With SSO, your team members can log in to Flipt using their existing credentials, making it easy to manage access and permissions.

SSO also enhances security by reducing the number of passwords your team members need to remember and ensuring that access is granted only to authorized users.

You can even setup custom SAML and OIDC providers, so you can use your existing identity management system with Flipt Hybrid Cloud, even if it's not one of our supported identity providers.

## User Management

Flipt Hybrid Cloud makes it easy to manage your team members and their permissions. You can invite users in your organization, assign roles, and control access to features and data.
