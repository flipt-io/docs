Flipt Managed Cloud is a fully managed solution where we host and operate Flipt for you. You no longer need to deploy or manage Flipt instances yourself. We provide a secure, scalable, and feature-rich environment with enterprise-grade authentication and authorization built-in.

While Flipt Managed Cloud is a completely managed service, it works hand in hand with Flipt Open Source. You can still deploy Flipt Open Source in your own infrastructure to scale as needed, while still using Flipt Managed Cloud for feature flag management.

Here are some of the basic concepts in Flipt Managed Cloud:

## Git-Backed Storage

Flipt Managed Cloud leverages Git repositories as the backbone for storing and managing your feature flag configurations. This innovative approach allows you to store your feature flag data in your own GitHub repositories, providing a unique blend of managed service convenience and data ownership.

See the [Git-Backed Storage](/cloud/features/git-backed-storage) page for more information.

## Environments

Environments in Flipt Managed Cloud are high-level groupings of feature flags and namespaces. They provide a way to organize and manage your feature flags across different stages of your development lifecycle or across various applications within your organization.

Key points about environments:

- **Logical Separation**: Environments allow you to logically separate your feature flags, making it easier to manage flags for different purposes (e.g., development, staging, production).
- **Independent Configuration**: Each environment can have its own set of feature flags, namespaces, and configurations, allowing for independent management and testing.

## Namespaces

Within each environment, Flipt Managed Cloud uses namespaces to further organize and group related feature flags.

Key points about namespaces:

- **Granular Organization**: Namespaces allow you to group related flags together, such as by team, feature set, or application component.
- **Isolation**: Flags in different namespaces are isolated from each other, preventing naming conflicts and improving organization.
- **Flexible Hierarchy**: You can create multiple namespaces within an environment, allowing for a flexible hierarchy that suits your organizational needs.
- **Managed Access Control**: Roles can be scoped to limit access to specific sets of namespaces.

By utilizing environments and namespaces effectively, you can create a well-organized and scalable feature flag management system that grows with your organization's needs.

## Sources

Sources in Flipt Managed Cloud are the connection points between your environments and our managed storage, implemented as Git repositories on GitHub. They play a crucial role in how your feature flag data is stored, versioned, and managed.

Key points about sources:

- **Git-Backed Storage**: Each source maps an environment to a specific Git repository, leveraging the power of version control for your feature flag configurations.
- **Data Sovereignty**: By using your own GitHub repositories, you maintain full control over your feature flag data, ensuring compliance with data regulations and internal policies.
- **Version Control**: Sources provide a comprehensive audit trail for all feature flag changes, making it easy to track who made what changes, when, and why.

Sources in Flipt Managed Cloud combine the benefits of Git-based version control with the ease of use of a managed service, providing a flexible and powerful foundation for your feature flag management.
