This page details how Flipt Cloud is architected to provide a simple and scalable solution for accessing and securing your internal, self-hosted deployments of Flipt.

Much like other great self-hosted, open-source developer tools with built-in user interfaces, Flipt itself comes baked with lots of critical features for scale and security.

- Horizontal scalability
- HTTPS/TLS support
- Configurable authentication mechanisms (Static Token, OIDC, GitHub, JWT and Kubernetes)
- API and UI with session management and termination

These capabilites are super important for being able to deploy Flipt onto your own infrastructure and make it secure for your users.
However, enabling and integrating these features is not free of its own complexities, infrastructure and time investment.
In order to take advantage of these, you're likely going to have to perform one or many of the following:

- Enable networking and routing to your Flipt instance
- Issue and assign an (internal or external) DNS name for your Flipt
- Add a load-balancer to distribute load across your instances of Flipt
- Issue TLS certificates and manage their rotation over time
- Manually configure OAuth client credentials for your SSO provider for OIDC authentication
- Deploy and manage a database for Flipt to store session credentials in

Flipt Cloud replaces all these steps with a few clicks and some API credentials.

## Flipt the problem on its head

Flipt Cloud reverses the ingress problem so that your deployments of Flipt dial out to us instead.
This approaches is commonly referred to as _reverse tunnelling_.
Tunnelling in this way has some advantages for applications, as they can be deployed in environments without a stable IP address (e.g. behind restrictive NATs).
For Flipt, this means you can safely expose Flipt from inside a major cloud provider, a modern hyperscaler or simply from your own laptop on your home network.

/>

When you register your instance in this way with Flipt Cloud, we issue you with a stable subdomain under flipt.cloud (e.g. production-megacorp.flipt.cloud).
Using this DNS name, requests for your instances will flow though our API gateways, load-balancers and then only reach your instances once fully authenticated.
This entire process is performed over secure TLS connections from your end users back to your instances.
All of which is done without you having to provide TLS certificates, and without having to manage rotation.

## Tunnel Registration

Your connections are made using an API key credential obtained from our Flipt Cloud UI, or via the `flipt cloud login` subcommand of the Flipt CLI.
This credential is used in an initial handshake to identify your Flipt Cloud organization and the logical instance your Flipt is joining.

Once registered and associated with Flipt Cloud, your Flipt instance is added to our remote load balancer pool for your logical instance.
Now when you visit your new Flipt Cloud instance subdomain, your requests are routed to the instance(s) deployed on your infrastructure.

The majority of the tunneling functionality we perform is now open-source in our project [Reverst](https://github.com/flipt-io/reverst).
Reverst is unique in that it leverages HTTP/3 and the QUIC protocol to establish secure, reliable and performant connections for tunnels.
Keep your eyes peeled for our upcoming blog on how and why we choose to build our reverse tunnels in this way.

We deploy and scale multiple instances of Reverst on our infrastructure for establishing and managing these tunnels for you.
All while tightly integrating them with the Flipt Cloud user interface, authentication and instance management system.
