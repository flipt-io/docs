Flipt Hybrid Cloud provides centralized audit logs to help you track changes to your feature flags and configurations. With audit logs, you can see who made changes, when they were made, and what changes were made. This makes it easy to track changes, troubleshoot issues, and maintain a history of your feature flag configurations.

<Note>
  Currently, audit logs are only available if Flipt is running with one of our
  [relational database backends](/configuration/storage#relational-database).
  We' re working on adding support for other storage backends in the future.

Audit logs are available for all changes made in your Flipt instances and can be accessed from the Flipt Hybrid Cloud dashboard.

You can opt specific instances in or out of audit logging to ensure that you are only tracking the changes in environments that are important to you.

## Filtering and Search

You can filter audit logs by user, date, and event type to quickly find the information you need.
