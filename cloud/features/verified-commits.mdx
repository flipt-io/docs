## Creating a signing key

![Signed Commits](/images/cloud/features/verified-commits/generate-key.png)

To verify commits with Flipt Cloud, we'll need to create a
signing key, as Flipt needs to be able to sign the commits it
creates itself.

To do this, head to your user settings in Flipt Cloud, and click 'Generate Key'.

## Adding your key to GitHub

Head to your [key settings](https://github.com/settings/keys) in GitHub, and add it
as an SSH **Signing Key**.

It's important that it should be a signing key, rather than an authentication
key, as we don't want this key to be able to push to your repositories, just to
verify commits.


## How we store your key

Flipt uses AWS KMS to generate and store your signing key, which means we don't
ever have access to the private key, and instead ask the KMS API to sign commits
using your key.
