Verify Flipt's commits to your GitHub repository with SSH signing keys. This ensures that commits are authentic and have not been tampered with. You can be confident that the commits you see in your repository are indeed from Flipt.

You can learn more about GitHub's commit verification in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification).

## Creating a Signing Key

![Signed Commits](/images/cloud/features/verified-commits/generate-key.png)

To verify commits with Flipt Cloud, we'll need to create a
signing key, as Flipt needs to be able to sign the commits it
creates itself.

To do this, head to your user settings in Flipt Cloud, and click 'Generate Key'.

## Adding Your Key to GitHub

Head to your [key settings](https://github.com/settings/keys) in GitHub, and add it
as an SSH **Signing Key**.

It's important that it should be a signing key, rather than an authentication
key, as we don't want this key to be able to push to your repositories, just to
verify commits.

## How We Store Your Key

Flipt uses [AWS Key Management Service (KMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) to generate and store your signing key. This means we don't
ever have access to the private key, and instead ask the KMS API to sign commits using your key.
