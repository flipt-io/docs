Role-based access control allows you to define custom roles and permissions for your team members.

![Roles](/images/cloud/features/rbac/roles.png)

You can create roles with specific permissions, such as read-only access to feature flags or the ability to create new flags. This gives you fine-grained control over who can do what in Flipt Cloud and your Flipt instances.

<Info>
  Role-based access control functionality is only available on our Team plan and
  above. See our [pricing page](https://www.flipt.io/pricing) for more
  information.

## Built-in Roles

Flipt Cloud comes with several built-in roles that you can assign to your team members:

- **Admin**: Full access to all resources and settings
- **Editor**: Can create and update most resources, but cannot delete them. Cannot access organization settings.
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to most resources, cannot create or update them. Cannot access organization settings.

Built-in roles cannot be modified or deleted, but you can create custom roles with specific permissions to meet your organization's needs.

## Custom Roles

You can create custom roles with any permissions you need. For example, you can create a role that allows users to create and update feature flags and segments, but not delete them.

## Assigning Roles

You can assign roles to team members after you invite them to your organization from the [user management](/cloud/features/user-management) page.

<Note>
  By default, all team members are assigned the `Viewer` role when they are
  invited to your organization.

## Role Scope

Roles are global across your organization, so a team member's role applies to all environments in your organization.

When your team members route to a Flipt instance through Flipt Cloud, their permissions are enforced based on the role assigned to them in the organization.
