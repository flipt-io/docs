## What Is Git-Backed Storage?

Flipt Cloud is unique in that it uses your existing Git repositories for your feature flags and configurations. This means that your feature flag data is stored in a Git repository of your choosing, which allows you to use your existing Git workflow and tools.

Flipt Cloud manages your feature flags in what we call [Environments](/cloud/concepts#environments).

Each environment can be connected to a different Git repository, allowing you to manage your feature flags in different repositories for different environments.

<Tip>
  Environments can also share the same Git repository, as long as they are configured to use different directories.

## Why Use Git-Backed Storage?

Git lives at the heart of Flipt Cloud. It allows you to use your existing Git workflow and tools, and it allows you to version your configuration data. However, we understand that not everyone is familiar with Git, and that it can be intimidating to use.

To solve for this, Flipt Cloud includes a friendly UI for managing your feature flags, so that you can easily change their state without even knowing that Git is used under the hood.

  [Benefits](/cloud/benefits#gitops-and-clickops-friendly) page.
</Note>

As developers ourselves, we understand the power of Git. It allows you to review and merge changes, and it allows you to see the history of your changes, quickly reverting to a previous state if needed.

Because we mirror your flag data in Git, you always have the ability to 'break the glass' and make changes directly to the Git repository if needed.

We believe that Git is the best way to manage configuration data. We also believe that feature flags are a type of configuration data, and as such, they should be in the same way.

By combining the power of Git with a user-friendly interface, Flipt Cloud offers the best of both worlds: the robustness and version control of Git-backed storage, and the ease of use of a modern feature flag management system.
