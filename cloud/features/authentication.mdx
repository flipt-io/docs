This flexibility allows you to choose the authentication method that best fits your organization's needs, whether you're a small startup or a large enterprise.

## Single Sign-On

Flipt Hybrid Cloud supports Single Sign-On (SSO) with popular identity providers like Okta, Microsoft Active Directory, and Google Workspace. With SSO, your team members can log in to Flipt using their existing credentials, making it easy to manage access and permissions.

SSO also enhances security by reducing the number of passwords your team members need to remember and ensuring that access is granted only to authorized users.

You can even setup custom SAML and OIDC providers, so you can use your existing identity management system with Flipt Hybrid Cloud, even if it's not one of our supported identity providers.
