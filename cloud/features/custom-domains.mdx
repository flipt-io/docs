## Overview

Flipt Cloud allows you to use your own custom domains for evaluating feature flags against your Flipt Cloud instances. This means you can replace the default `*.flipt.cloud` domain with your own domain (like `features.acme.com`) when making API calls to Flipt.

This is useful if you want to use a domain (or subdomain) that you already own in order to provide a branded experience for your users.

<Info>
  Custom domains are only available on our Team plan and above and incur a small
  additional cost per month.

## Why Use Custom Domains?

There are a couple of reasons why you might want to use a custom domain with Flipt Cloud.

### Professional Branding & White Labeling

By default when using Flipt Cloud, every environment gets its own subdomain at `{your-environment}-{your-organization}.flipt.cloud`. When configuring our SDKs to evaluate feature flags, this is the domain that you'll use.

For example, if you have an environment called `dev` and an organization called `acme`, the default domain for that environment will be `dev-acme.flipt.cloud`.

Normally this is no big deal, but if you're using Flipt Cloud to power a product that you're selling to your customers, you may want to use your own domain to provide a branded experience. Particularly if you're using Flipt Cloud to power a mobile or browser based product, it's relatively easy for your users to inspect the network requests and see `flipt.cloud` in the request.

By using your own domain, you can provide a more branded experience for your users, making the integration feel more seamless and professional.

Instead of:

```
https://dev-acme.flipt.cloud
```

You can use your own domain or subdomain:

```
https://features.acme.com
```

### Enhanced Security & Compliance

Using custom domains can provide several security benefits:

1. **Domain Allowlisting**: Many organizations maintain strict allowlists of approved domains for outbound network requests. Using your own domain makes it easier to comply with these security policies without having to allowlist `*.flipt.cloud`.

2. **Network Isolation**: Some organizations use internal DNS to route traffic through security appliances or VPNs. Custom domains allow you to configure your DNS to route Flipt traffic through your existing security infrastructure.

3. **Data Privacy**: Using your own domain helps mask the use of third-party services from end users, making it harder for potential attackers to identify which services your application depends on.

## Setting Up Custom Domains

<Tip>
  We're working on a guide to walk you through the process of setting up a
  custom domain. Check back soon for more details!
</Tip>

Using custom domains with Flipt Cloud is a simple three step process:

1. **Configure the Domain**: Once enabled, you can add your custom domain to your Flipt Cloud environment in the Flipt Cloud UI.

2. **Configure the DNS**: You'll need to configure the DNS for your custom domain to point to your existing Flipt Cloud environment.

3. **Update Your SDKs**: Once the DNS has propagated, you simply need to update your SDKs to use the new domain.

```typescript {2}
const fliptEvaluationClient = await FliptEvaluationClient.init("default", {
  url: "https://features.acme.com",
  authentication: {
    clientToken,
  },
});
```

## Limitations

- Custom domains are a paid feature available on Team plans and above
- Custom domains can only be used with Flipt Cloud Client SDKs for evaluating feature flags
- The Flipt Cloud UI will continue to use the `*.flipt.cloud` domain
