## Just in Time User Provisioning

With our [SSO](/cloud/features/authentication##single-sign-on) and Directory Sync features, you can automatically provision users in Flipt Hybrid Cloud when they log in for the first time. This makes it easy to manage access and permissions for your team members, without having to manually invite or create users.

## Role-Based Access Control

**Coming soon!** Role-based access control will allow you to define custom roles and permissions for your team members. You can create roles with specific permissions, such as read-only access to feature flags or the ability to create new flags. This gives you fine-grained control over who can do what in Flipt Hybrid Cloud and your Flipt instances.
