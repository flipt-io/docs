## Just in Time User Provisioning

With our [SSO](/cloud/features/authentication##single-sign-on) and Directory Sync features, you can automatically provision users in Flipt Cloud when they log in for the first time. This makes it easy to manage access and permissions for your team members, without having to manually invite or create users.
