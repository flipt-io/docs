  here](https://tally.so/r/mV0zWM).
</Info>

## Prerequisites

Before you get started with Flipt Hybrid Cloud, you need to have the following:

1. An active Flipt Hybrid Cloud account. If you don't have an account yet, [sign up here](https://tally.so/r/mV0zWM) and we'll get you set up.
2. The Flipt CLI installed on your local machine. You can install the CLI by following the instructions in the [Flipt CLI documentation](/cli/overview).
3. Enable the `cloud` [experimental feature](/configuration/experimental) in the Flipt configuration file. You can enable the `cloud` feature by adding the following configuration to your `flipt.yaml` file:

```yaml
experimental:
  cloud:
    enabled: true
```

<Note>
  Make sure you have the [latest
  version](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/releases/latest) of the Flipt CLI
  installed on your local machine.

## Trying It Out

To quickly get started with Flipt Hybrid Cloud, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authenticate with CLI">
    Authenticate with the Flipt CLI using the following command:

    ```bash
    flipt cloud login
    ```

    This command will open a browser on your local machine and allow you to authenticate with your Flipt Hybrid Cloud account.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Your Local Instance">
    Connect your local Flipt instance to Flipt Hybrid Cloud using the following command:

    ```bash
    flipt cloud serve
    ```

    This command will register your local Flipt instance temporarily with Flipt Hybrid Cloud. This allows you to test the integration without affecting your production environments.

    After following the prompts in the CLI, you should see a success message indicating that your local instance is connected to Flipt Hybrid Cloud along with a unique address for your local instance.

    Behind the scenes, Flipt Hybrid Cloud will create a secure tunnel to your local instance via what we call a gateway, allowing you to access it from anywhere in the world.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Login to Hybrid Cloud">
  Next, log in to the Flipt Hybrid Cloud web interface using the unique address provided in the previous step. You can access the web interface by navigating to the provided address in your browser.

Once you are logged in, you will see the Flipt Hybrid Cloud dashboard. Click on the "Dashboard" tab in the sidebar to view your environments.

You should see your new temporary address listed here under `Development Environments`. Click on the entry name to view more details and manage it's settings.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Route to Your Instance">
  Click on the URL to route to your local instance. The address will look something like `https://{environment}-{organization}.flipt.cloud`.

This will route to your local Flipt instance via your browser.

  Note that you didn't have to mess with DNS or firewall settings to enable the
  connection between Flipt and your instance. Flipt Hybrid Cloud takes care of
  all the networking for you.

### Details

- You now have a fully functional Flipt instance running on your local machine that's protected behind authentication provided by Flipt Hybrid Cloud. üîí

- You can now access your local instance through the Flipt Hybrid Cloud web interface from anywhere in the world! üåç

- Only users in your organization with the appropriate permissions can access your instance through Flipt Hybrid Cloud. üõ°Ô∏è

The unique address provided in the CLI is a temporary route to your local instance. You can access your local instance through this address until the connection expires or your local instance is disconnected.

<Note>
  The connection between your local instance and Flipt Hybrid Cloud is temporary
  and will expire after about 24 hours.
</Note>

## What's Next?

Now that you have successfully connected your local Flipt instance to Flipt Hybrid Cloud, you can start creating feature flags and managing your feature flag configurations.

After you've had a chance to play around with Flipt Hybrid Cloud and your local instance, you can learn more about the advanced features and capabilities available to you in the [Flipt Hybrid Cloud documentation](/cloud/overview).

Finally, consider connecting your production instance to Flipt Hybrid Cloud to manage your feature flags and configurations in your production environment. You can learn more about how to do this in the [Production Guide](/cloud/guides/production).
