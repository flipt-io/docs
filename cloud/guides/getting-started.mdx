## Trying It Out

To quickly get started with Flipt Hybrid Cloud, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Your Local Instance">
    Connect your local Flipt instance to Flipt Hybrid Cloud using the following command:

    ```bash
    flipt cloud serve
    ```

    This command will register your local Flipt instance temporarily with Flipt Hybrid Cloud. This allows you to test the integration without affecting your production environments.

    It will prompt you to log in to your Flipt Hybrid Cloud account and then create a secure tunnel to your local instance via what we call a gateway, allowing you to access it from anywhere in the world.

  </Step>
  <Step title="View Your Environments">

Once you are logged in and your instance is connected, head back to Flipt Hybrid Cloud in your browser. Click on the "Dashboard" tab in the sidebar to view your environments.

You should see your new temporary address listed here under `Development Environments`.

Click on the entry name to view more details and manage it's settings.

This will route to your local Flipt instance via your browser.
