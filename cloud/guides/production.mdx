<Info>
  Flipt Enterprise Cloud is currently in beta. Visit our
  [website](https://flipt.io/cloud) to learn more and sign up today!
</Info>

## Prerequisites

Before you get started with Flipt Enterprise Cloud, you need to have the following:

1. An active Flipt Enterprise Cloud account. If you don't have an account yet, [sign up here](https://flipt.cloud).
2. Enable the `cloud` [experimental feature](/configuration/experimental) in the Flipt configuration file. You can enable the `cloud` feature by adding the following configuration to your `flipt.yaml` file:

```yaml
experimental:
  cloud:
    enabled: true
```

<Note>
  Make sure you have the [latest
  version](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/releases/latest) of the Flipt CLI
  installed on your local machine.
</Note>

## Create a New Environment

To move your local Flipt instance to production, you need to create a new environment in Flipt Enterprise Cloud. This environment will be used to manage your feature flags and configurations in a production.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Login to Enterprise Cloud">
  First, log in to the Flipt Enterprise Cloud web interface. You can access the login page at [https://flipt.cloud](https://flipt.cloud).
  
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a New Environment">

Once you are logged in, you will see the Flipt Enterprise Cloud dashboard. Click on one of our suggested environments named either `Staging` or `Production`, or click on `Or something else` to create a custom environment.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Name Your Environment">

Give your environment a name and description to help you identify it later.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Download Configuration">

Next, click on the `Download` button to download the configuration file for your instance.

This configuration file contains the required settings for your instance to connect to your environment in Flipt Enterprise Cloud.

Move the configuration file to your local [Flipt instance directory](/configuration/overview#configuration-file)

```bash
mv ~/downloads/flipt.yaml /path/to/your/flipt/directory
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Configuration">

Open the configuration file you downloaded in the previous step and update the `cloud` section with the API key you generated in the previous step for your instance.

```yaml
cloud:
  authentication:
    api_key: "YOUR API KEY HERE"
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Flipt">

Start your Flipt instance with the updated configuration file.

```bash
flipt
```

or if you have a custom configuration file:

```bash
# if your configuration file is in a different location than the default
flipt -f /path/to/your/configuration.yaml
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Connection Successful">

After you've started your Flipt instance, go back to the Flipt Enterprise Cloud dashboard and you should see a successful connection message.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Route to Your Instance">

Click on the `All done!` button to be taken back to the Flipt Enterprise Cloud dashboard.

Click on the URL in the `Host` column to route to your instance.

You are automatically authenticated with your Flipt Enterprise Cloud account and can start managing your feature flags and configurations in your production environment.

  <Info>
    The address provided in the Flipt Enterprise Cloud dashboard is a permanent route to your instance. You can access your instance through this address at any time.
  </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Just Happened?

You have successfully and permanently connected your Flipt instance to Flipt Enterprise Cloud! üéâ

<Check>
  Note that you didn't have to mess with DNS or firewall settings to enable the
  connection between Flipt and your instance. Flipt Enterprise Cloud takes care
  of all the networking for you.
</Check>

### Details

- You now have a fully functional Flipt instance running in your infrastructure that's protected behind authentication provided by Flipt Enterprise Cloud. üîí

- You can now access this instance through the Flipt Enterprise Cloud web interface from anywhere in the world! üåç

- Only users in your organization with the appropriate permissions can access your instance through Flipt Enterprise Cloud. üõ°Ô∏è

The address provided in the Flipt Enterprise Cloud dashboard is a permanent route to your instance. You can access your instance through this address at any time and it will not expire.

<Note>
  The connection is valid as long as your API Key stays the same. 
  
  If you need to regenerate your API Key, you can generate a new one by clicking on the environment in the Flipt Enterprise Cloud dashboard and clicking on the `Configuration` tab.

</Note>

## What's Next?

Now that you have successfully connected your permanent instance to Flipt Enterprise Cloud, you can start creating feature flags and managing your feature flag configurations.

You can now learn more about the advanced features and capabilities available to you such as [Single Sign-On](/cloud/features/authentication), [Role-Based Access Control](/cloud/features/rbac), and [Audit Logs](/cloud/features/audit-logs).
