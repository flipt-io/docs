<Info>
  Flipt Managed Cloud is currently in beta. Some functionality may be subject to
  change.

Interested in joining the beta? [Request access here](https://flipt.cloud).

</Info>

## Prerequisites

Before you move to production, you need to have the following:

1. An active Flipt Managed Cloud account. If you don't have an account yet, [request access here](https://flipt.cloud).
2. An active GitHub account. If you don't have an account yet, [sign up on GitHub](https://github.com).
3. A configured Flipt environment in Flipt Managed Cloud. If you don't have an environment yet, [follow the getting started guide](/cloud/guides/getting-started).
4. Deployed Flipt instances in your infrastructure. If you don't have Flipt instances yet, [deploy Flipt Open Source](https://docs.flipt.io/self-hosted/overview).

## Create an API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Login to Managed Cloud">
  First, log in to the Flipt Managed Cloud web interface. You can access the login page at [https://flipt.cloud](https://flipt.cloud).
  
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to your Environment">

From the Flipt Managed Cloud dashboard, find the environment you want to create an API key for and hover over the environment name.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Click on the Edit link">

Click on the `Edit` link.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an API Key">

Click on the `Security` tab and then click on the `Create API Key` button.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Name your API Key">

Give your API a name to help you identify it later and click on the `Create` button.

## Configure a Client-Side SDK

Currently, Flipt Managed Cloud only support client-side SDKs for direct evaluation via the Flipt Cloud API.

<Note>
  For more information on the architecture of Flipt Managed Cloud, see the
  [architecture overview](/cloud/architecture).
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    Chose the SDK that matches your application's language and install it. All Client-side SDKs are documented [here](/integration/client).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the SDK">
    Configure the SDK with the API key you created in the previous step and set the following options:
    - `URL`: The URL of the Flipt Cloud API.
    - `Authentication`: The API key authentication method configured with the API key you created in the previous step.
    - (Optional) `Namespace`: The namespace to use for the SDK. (Default: `default`)

    For example, here's how you can configure the SDK for a Go application:

    ```go
    evaluationClient, _ := flipt.NewClient(
        flipt.WithURL("https://<environment>-<organization>.flipt.cloud"),
        flipt.WithClientTokenAuthentication(<api-key>),
        flipt.WithNamespace(<namespace>)
    )
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Use the SDK">
    That's it! ðŸŽ‰ You can now use the SDK to evaluate feature flags and configurations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Scale and Configure Server-Side SDKs

As mentioned in the [architecture overview](/cloud/architecture), Flipt Managed Cloud is designed to be used in conjunction with Flipt Open Source. This means that you can still use your existing Flipt instances and configurations while leveraging the security and user friendly features of Flipt Managed Cloud.

Here's how you can configure your Flipt instances to use the Git repository data source and then use our server-side SDKs to evaluate feature flags within your infrastructure.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure the Flipt instances">
    Configure the Flipt instances to use the Git repository data source.

    As described in the Flipt Open Source [storage documentation](/configuration/storage#git), you can configure the Flipt instances to use the Git repository data source.

    Here you can use the same repository and branch as you used when creating the Flipt Managed Cloud environment.

    ```yaml
    storage:
    type: git
    git:
        repository: "https://github.com/<git-organization>/<git-repository>"
        ref: "main"
        poll_interval: "30s"
        authentication:
            token:
                access_token: <git-access-token>
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Restart the Flipt instances">
    Restart the Flipt instances to apply the changes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    Chose the SDK that matches your application's language and install it. All Server-side SDKs are documented [here](/integration/server).

    <Note>
    You can also use any of our [OpenFeature SDKs](/integration/openfeature) or [OpenFeature Remote Evaluation Protocol implementations](/integration/openfeature#remote-evaluation-protocol) to evaluate feature flags within your infrastructure.
    </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the SDK">
    Configure the SDK with the URL of your Flipt instance within your infrastructure.
    - `URL`: The URL of the Flipt instance.

    For example, here's how you can configure the OpenFeature SDK for a Go application:

    ```go
    provider := flipt.NewProvider(flipt.WithAddress("https://localhost:443")) // Replace with the URL of your Flipt instance
    openfeature.SetProvider(provider)

    client := openfeature.NewClient("my-app")
    value, err := client.BooleanValue(context.Background(), "v2_enabled", false, openfeature.NewEvaluationContext(
        "tim@apple.com",
        map[string]interface{}{
            "favorite_color": "blue",
        },
    ))
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Scale">
    That's it! ðŸŽ‰ You can now scale your feature flagging operations with Flipt Managed Cloud and Flipt Open Source.

    All changes to the feature flags and configurations are automatically propagated to your Flipt instances within your infrastructure through the Git repository data source.

  </Step>
</Steps>
