  Flipt Hybrid Cloud is in Active Beta. We're currently onboarding organizations
  one by one. If you are interested in joining the beta, please [sign up
  here](https://tally.so/r/mV0zWM).
</Info>

## Prerequisites

Before you get started with Flipt Hybrid Cloud, you need to have the following:

1. An active Flipt Hybrid Cloud account. If you don't have an account yet, [sign up here](https://tally.so/r/mV0zWM) and we'll get you set up.
2. Completed the [Getting Started](/cloud/guides/getting-started) guide to setup your local Flipt instance and authenticate with the Flipt CLI.
3. Enable the `cloud` [experimental feature](/configuration/experimental) in the Flipt configuration file. You can enable the `cloud` feature by adding the following configuration to your `flipt.yaml` file:

```yaml
experimental:
  cloud:
    enabled: true
```

<Note>
  Make sure you have the [latest
  version](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/releases/latest) of the Flipt CLI
  installed on your local machine.
</Note>

## Create a New Gateway

To move your local Flipt instance to production, you need to create a new gateway in Flipt Hybrid Cloud. This gateway will be used to manage your feature flags and configurations in a production environment.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Login to Hybrid Cloud">
  First, log in to the Flipt Hybrid Cloud web interface. You can access the login page at [https://flipt.cloud](https://flipt.cloud).
  
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a New Gateway">

Once you are logged in, you will see the Flipt Hybrid Cloud dashboard. Click on the `Create Your First Gateway` button to create a new gateway.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Gateway API Key">

In order authenticate your running Flipt instance with your new gateway in Flipt Hybrid Cloud, you'll need to create a gateway API token.

Click on the `Configuration` tab in the gateway details page and then click on the `Gateway API Key` button.

Copy the API key and save it for later.

<Warning>
  The API key is a secret token that allows your Flipt instances to authenticate with your gateway in Flipt Hybrid Cloud. Keep it secure and do not share it with anyone.

If you lose your API key, you can always generate a new one by following the same steps.

</Warning>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Download Configuration">

Next, click on the `Download Configuration` button to download the configuration file for your instance.

This configuration file contains the required settings for your instance to connect to your gateway in Flipt Hybrid Cloud.

Move the configuration file to your local [Flipt instance directory](/configuration/overview#configuration-file)

```bash
mv ~/downloads/flipt.yaml /path/to/your/flipt/directory
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Configuration">

Open the configuration file you downloaded in the previous step and update the `cloud` section with the API key you generated in the previous step for your instance.

```yaml
cloud:
  authentication:
    api_key: "YOUR API KEY HERE"
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Flipt">

Start your Flipt instance with the updated configuration file.

```bash
flipt
```

or if you have a custom configuration file:

```bash
# if your configuration file is in a different location than the default
flipt -f /path/to/your/configuration.yaml
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Refresh Gateway Details">

After you've started your Flipt instance, go back to the Flipt Hybrid Cloud dashboard and refresh the page.

You should see that your gateway is now connected and showing one active connection.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Route to Your Instance">

Click on the your gateway address to route to your instance. The address will look something like `https://{gateway}-{organization}.flipt.cloud`.

This will route to your local Flipt instance in your browser.

You are automatically authenticated with your Flipt Hybrid Cloud account and can start managing your feature flags and configurations in your production environment.

  <Info>
    The address provided in the Flipt Hybrid Cloud dashboard is a permanent route to your instance. You can access your instance through this address at any time.
  </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Just Happened?

You have successfully and permanently connected your Flipt instance to Flipt Hybrid Cloud! üéâ

<Check>
  Note that you didn't have to mess with DNS or firewall settings to enable the
  connection between Flipt and your instance. Flipt Hybrid Cloud takes care of
  all the networking for you.
</Check>

### Details

- You now have a fully functional Flipt instance running in your infrastructure that's protected behind authentication provided by Flipt Hybrid Cloud. üîí

- You can now access this instance through the Flipt Hybrid Cloud web interface from anywhere in the world! üåç

- Only users in your organization with the appropriate permissions can access your instance through Flipt Hybrid Cloud. üõ°Ô∏è

Unlike in the [Getting Started](/cloud/guides/getting-started) guide, the address provided in the Flipt Hybrid Cloud dashboard is a permanent route to your instance. You can access your instance through this address at any time and it will not expire.

<Note>
  The connection is valid as long as your API Key stays the same. If you need to
  regenerate your API Key, you can generate a new one by following the same
  steps.
</Note>

## What's Next?

Now that you have successfully connected your permanent instance to Flipt Hybrid Cloud, you can start creating feature flags and managing your feature flag configurations.

You can now learn more about the advanced features and capabilities available to you such as [Single Sign-On](/cloud/features/authentication) and [Audit Logs](/cloud/features/audit-logs).
