At Flipt, we aim to provide the best possible feature flagging experience for our users. That's why we're excited to introduce Flipt Managed Cloud, a new offering that combines the best of both worlds: the simplicity and flexibility of open-source Flipt with the scalability and reliability of a managed cloud service.

## Limitless Scalability

One of the biggest challenges with traditional feature flagging solutions is that they often come with limits. Whether it's the number of flags you can create, the number of evaluations/requests you can make, or the amount of data you can store, these limits can be frustrating and restrictive. With Flipt Managed Cloud, we've removed these limits, giving you the freedom to create as many flags as you need, invite as many users as you want, and store as much data as you require.

We believe that you should never have to worry about hitting a limit or being charged extra for using too much of a service. With Flipt Managed Cloud, you can focus on building great products without having to worry about artificial constraints.

## The Best of Both Worlds

Traditional SaaS solutions force you to give up control over your data in exchange for convenience, while self-hosted and in-house solutions lack features that enterprise customers need.

With Flipt Managed Cloud, you get the best of both worlds. You get the security, convenience and ease of use of a managed SaaS solution, along with the control and ability to own your own data that self-hosted solutions provide.

Our platform provides the essential features and functionality for building great products, all without compromising on security, control, or scalability.

## GitOps and ClickOps friendly

Flipt Managed Cloud offers a unique approach to feature flag management by storing your feature flag data in a Git repository of your choosing. This innovative method brings several key benefits:

1. **Data Sovereignty**: By keeping your feature flag configurations in your own Git repository, you maintain full control over your data. You decide where it's stored, who has access, and how it's managed, ensuring compliance with data regulations and internal policies.

2. **Zero Lock-in**: With your feature flag data in a standard Git format, you're never locked into our platform. You can easily export or migrate your data at any time, giving you the freedom to switch providers or solutions as your needs evolve.

3. **Familiar Developer Workflow**: Storing feature flags alongside your code allows developers to work with tools they already know and love. They can use their preferred Git workflows, code review processes, and CI/CD pipelines to manage feature flags just like any other code changes.

4. **Version Control and Audit Trail**: Git's inherent version control capabilities provide a comprehensive audit trail for all feature flag changes. This makes it easy to track who made what changes, when, and why – crucial for debugging and compliance.

5. **Environment Consistency**: By treating feature flags as code, you can ensure consistency across different environments. Use branching strategies to manage feature flags for development, staging, and production environments, just as you would with application code.

6. **Collaboration and Code Reviews**: Leverage Git's collaboration features for feature flag management. Use pull requests to review and discuss flag changes before they're implemented, fostering better communication and reducing errors.

7. **Rollback and Recovery**: If a feature flag causes issues, you can quickly roll back to a previous state using Git's revert capabilities, minimizing downtime and impact on users.

While these Git-based features offer powerful capabilities for technical users, Flipt Managed Cloud is designed to be accessible to all. Our intuitive user interface allows non-technical team members to easily manage feature flags without any knowledge of Git. They can create, update, and toggle flags through our user-friendly dashboard, while behind the scenes, Flipt handles the Git operations seamlessly.

This hybrid approach ensures that both technical and non-technical users can collaborate effectively, leveraging the power of Git-based workflows without the complexity. It's the perfect balance of power and simplicity, making Flipt Managed Cloud an ideal solution for teams of all sizes and technical backgrounds.

## Enterprise Ready

We understand that enterprise customers have unique needs and requirements. That's why we've designed Flipt Managed Cloud to be enterprise-ready from day one. With features like directory sync, single sign-on, and role-based access control, you can be confident that Flipt Managed Cloud will meet the needs of your organization.

Our scalable infrastructure is designed to handle high-volume traffic and complex flag evaluations, making Flipt Managed Cloud suitable for organizations of any size, from startups to large enterprises with global operations.

## Cost-Effective and Predictable Pricing

Unlike many feature flag services that charge based on the number of environment, flags or evaluations, Flipt Managed Cloud offers a simple, predictable pricing model. You pay for the features you need, without worrying about unexpected costs as your usage grows. This allows for better budget planning and eliminates the need to constantly monitor usage to avoid overage charges.
