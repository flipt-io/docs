title: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
description: This document describes how to configure and use role-based access control (RBAC) with Flipt.

As described in the [Authorization Overview](/authorization/overview), Flipt supports the ability to secure its core API routes with authorization in a flexible and extensible way. 

This document will cover how to configure and use role-based access control (RBAC) with Flipt with a Rego policy configured for an imaginary organization and authentication provider.

<Note>
Role-based access control (RBAC) is not a feature of Flipt itself but rather a pattern that can be implemented using Flipt's authorization system via OPA.

## Configuring RBAC

To configure RBAC with Flipt, you will need to define a Rego policy that enforces the roles and permissions for your organization.

Here's an example of a simple policy that checks whether a user has the `admin` role:

```rego
package flipt.authz

default allow = false

allow {
    input.authentication.roles[_] == "admin"
}
```

In this example, the policy checks if the user has the `admin` role. If the user has the `admin` role, the policy will allow the request. Otherwise, the request will be denied.

The `authentication` input is provided by Flipt to OPA and contains the authentication information for the request. This information is specific to the authentication method used to authenticate the request.

More complex policies can be defined to enforce fine-grained access control based on your organization's requirements. For example, you could define policies that check for specific roles and permissions for different resources or actions.

An example policy that allows users with the `admin` role to have full access to the Management API and users with the `viewer` role to have read-only access might look like this:

```rego
package flipt.authz

default allow = false

allow {
    input.authentication.roles[_] == "admin"
}

allow {
    input.authentication.roles[_] == "viewer"
    input.request.verb = "read"
}
```
