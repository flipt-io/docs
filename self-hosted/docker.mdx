The simplest way to run Flipt is via Docker. This streamlines the installation
and configuration by using a reliable runtime.

### Prerequisites

Docker installation is required on the host, see the [official installation docs](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

<Note>
  Flipt requires Docker Engine version
  [20.10](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/20.10/) or higher.
</Note>

### Running

```console
docker run -d \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -p 9000:9000 \
    -v $HOME/flipt:/var/opt/flipt \
    docker.flipt.io/flipt/flipt:latest
```

This will download the image and start a Flipt container and publish ports
needed to access the UI and backend server. All persistent Flipt data will be
stored in `$HOME/flipt`.

<Info>
  `$HOME/flipt` is just used as an example, you can use any directory you would
  like on the host.
</Info>

The Flipt container uses host-mounted volumes to persist data:

| Host location | Container location | Purpose                      |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| $HOME/flipt   | /var/opt/flipt     | For storing application data |

This allows data to persist between Docker container restarts.

<Warning>
  If you don't use mounted volumes to persist your data, your data will be lost
  when the container exits!
</Warning>

After starting the container you can visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to view the
application.

<Note>Flipt runs without the root user in the Docker container.</Note>

### Configuration

A default configuration file within the image. To supply a custom configuration, update the `docker run` command to mount your local configuration into the container

```console
docker run -d \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -p 9000:9000 \
    -v $HOME/flipt:/var/opt/flipt \
    -v $HOME/flipt/config.yaml:/etc/flipt/config.yaml \
    docker.flipt.io/flipt/flipt:latest
```
