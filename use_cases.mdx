description: In this section we will explore two of the most common use cases that Flipt.
---

## Feature Flagging

Feature flagging can be used to switch features on and off. This can be done by
toggling a flag within Flipt.

Once you have a flag created, you can control whether or not a feature is
enabled within your application by toggling the `enable` slider in the Flipt UI.

An example request to evaluate whether or not this flag is enabled would look
like this:

```go
res, err := client.GetFlag(context.Background(), &flipt.GetFlagRequest{
  Key: "test-flag",
})
```

The response will contain a field `Enabled`, which could be used like this:

```go
if res.Enabled {
  // Code for your feature
}
```

## Percentage Rollouts

Variant testing can be accomplished by setting up a percentage rollout rule in
Flipt. See [Getting Started](/introduction) to learn how to accomplish this.

In this example rule, we have two variants that we are targeting, `group-a` and
`group-b`, each with a 50% distribution.

![Flag Targeting](/images/flag_targeting_rollout-6204b84a063949c817a94ba883ffbc2c.png)

An example request to evaluate this rule within your application would look like
this:

```go
res, err := client.Evaluate(context.Background(), &flipt.EvaluationRequest{
  FlagKey:  "new-landing-page",
  EntityId: "test@email.com",
})
```

<Note>
  Notice that we are using an email address for the `EntityId`. This does not
  need to be an email address, it just needs to be a unique identifier for your
  users.
</Note>

The response will contain which variant we should show for this user, either
`group-a` or `group-b`:

```go
if res.Value == "group-a" {
  // Render landing page for group a
} else {
  // Render landing page for group b
}
```
