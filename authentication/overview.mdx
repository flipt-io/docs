title: Overview
description: This document describes how to enable and use authentication with Flipt.
---

Flipt supports the ability to secure its core API routes.

<Info>
Flipt authentication is **disabled** (not required) by default.

Head to the [Configuration: Authentication](/configuration/authentication) section to enable it.

</Info>

Once enabled, all routes beneath the following API prefixes will require a [client token](#client-tokens) in order to authenticate requests:

- `/api/v1/`
- `/auth/v1/`
- `/meta`

<Warning>
The following URLs are not protected by authentication:

- `/debug`
- `/metrics`
- `/health`

They are currently unprotected to support backwards compatibility.
We're exploring ways to support protecting these endpoints going forward.
For now, we recommened excluding these API prefixes from your load-balancer.

</Warning>

## Client Tokens

Client tokens are the core credential required to authenticate a request.
Tokens themselves are acquired via [authentication methods](/authentication/methods).

Flipt currently supports two authentication methods for acquiring credentials:

1. [Static Token](/authentication/methods/#static-token)
2. [OIDC](/authentication/methods/#oidc)

Once a `client token` has been acquired, it can be supplied via request metadata dependent on the protocol. Both HTTP and gRPC examples can be found on the [Using Client Tokens](/authentication/using-tokens) page.

## Authorization

Currently, Flipt only supports authentication without any extended authorization capabilities.
Authorization is something we're actively exploring and we will update this section as we settle on a design.

We would appreciate your input into designing authorization. Head over to [our discord](https://flipt.io/discord) and let us know what you need from Flipt.
