## Static Token

The `token` authentication method supports statically creating authentication tokens.

Once enabled, the `/auth/v1/method/token` API prefix is mounted to Flipt's API.
This section of the API supports the creation of static tokens.

### Token Management

Tokens can be created and deleted via either the UI or API.

#### API

The following `curl` command creates a static token with no expiration.
Given authentication is set to `required` then a prior client token will be required to perform this action.

```console
curl -X POST localhost:8080/auth/v1/method/token \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer gt6P_zIqTnCngfHDCpWb48ob5EBt3PqunUhpofNCNnc=' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{"name":"access_all_areas","description":"keys to the castle"}'
```

#### UI

The UI also supports the creation and deletion of tokens. To access this functionality, navigate to `Settings` from the main menu and see the 'Static Tokens' section.

### Bootstrapping

On first startup, Flipt will automatically create a random static token with the name `initial_bootstrap_token` if one doesn't already exist and if `token` authentication is enabled.

![Bootstrap Token](/images/authentication/bootstrap-token.png)

This token is intended to be used to create additional tokens to then be used for subsequent API requests. By default it has no expiration date, therefore it's recommended that this token be deleted once the initial bootstrapping is complete.

This token is output to the Flipt logs on startup and can be found by searching for `client_token` in the logs:

```console
INFO	access token created	{"server": "grpc", "client_token": "jWLUy8ChnVDs-Llgyj7cMIzB0PfplwbBy-B27a0p23I="}
```

This initial bootstrap process can also be configured to use a known token by setting the `bootstrap.token` value in the configuration file. This is useful if you want to prevent having to search the logs after startup or if Flipt is deployed in an automated fashion, for example if you are using a configuration management tool.

The bootstrap token can also be configured to have an expiration date by setting the `bootstrap.expiration` value in the configuration file. This is useful if you want to ensure that the bootstrap token is only valid for a short period of time before automatically expiring.

See the [Configuration: Method Token](/configuration/overview#authentication-methods-token) documentation for more details.

### Token Expiration

Tokens can be created with an optional expiration date. This can be used to ensure that a token is only valid for a short period of time before automatically expiring. Expired tokens will be automatically be deleted by Flipt. The interval and grace period for this cleanup process can be configured via the `token.cleanup.interval` and `token.cleanup.grace_period` values in the configuration.

### Namespaced Tokens

Tokens can be created with an optional namespace to allow for more granular control over access to resources. Namespaces allow for grouping resources such as flags, segments, etc. To learn more about namespaces, see the [Concepts: Namespaces](/concepts#namespaces) documentation.

Namespaced tokens are useful for the scenario when you want to limit the privileges of an integration such as a CI/CD pipeline or internal service.

<Info>
  It's important to note that namespaced tokens offer limited access to the
  Flipt API, as only API requests that can be scoped to a namespace are
  supported.
</Info>

For example, the `/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/flags` endpoint supports a `namespace` parameter, therefore a namespaced token can be used to access this endpoint. However, the `/auth/v1/tokens` endpoint is not associated with a single `namespace`, so a namespaced token cannot be used to access this endpoint.

This also means that namespaced tokens themselves cannot be used to create additional tokens. Tokens must be created using a non-namespaced (default) token.

## OpenID Connect

[OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) (OIDC) is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

<Note>
Flipt's own UI is designed to support this authentication method natively.
Meaning, once enabled, the UI will support login and present each provider as a login button.

The rest of this information is mostly academic.
It's mainly useful if you want to build your own browser application using cookie authentication or understand Flipt's OIDC flow at a lower level.

Head over to [OIDC Configuration](/configuration/authentication#method-oidc) documentation to learn how to configure your provider(s).

</Note>

The `OIDC` authentication method is primarily designed to support browser-based authentication.
However, it can be manually invoked if such a use case presents itself.

Once enabled, the `/auth/v1/method/oidc` API prefix is mounted to Flipt's API.
This section of the API supports a generic OAuth 2.0 with OIDC flow.

Flipt's configuration can be defined with multiple simultaneous OIDC providers.
An operator of Flipt chooses a name for each provider and then configures the relevant secrets necessary to authenticate with an OIDC client.

Numerous OIDC providers are available. For example, we've tested Flipt with:

- Google
- Auth0
- GitLab
- Dex
- Okta
- AzureAD
- Keycloak

Each provider has their own way of establishing clients and acquiring the relevant credentials.
You can find further documentation on leveraging providers like these in our [OIDC Configuration](/configuration/authentication#method-oidc) documentation.

For illustration purposes, let us say we've configured a single provider with `Dex` and named it `dex` (lowercase) in our provider configuration.

This will lead to the following endpoints being available on Flipt:

- `GET /auth/v1/method/oidc/dex/authorize`
- `GET /auth/v1/method/oidc/dex/callback`

These two endpoints are necessary to support the different legs of the OAuth/OIDC flow.
The first can be requested to obtain an authorization URL directed at the configured instance of Dex.
The latter is the destination that Dex will redirect the client back to.
When using HTTP, this callback endpoint will establish a cookie named `flipt_client_token` and return it via the `Set-Cookie` response header.

## GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com) is an OAuth 2.0 implementation compatible with GitHub.

<Note>
  As with OIDC, the GitHub method works natively with the Flipt UI. Once
  enabled, the UI will support a "Login with GitHub" login option.
</Note>

The `GitHub` authentication method is primarily designed to support browser-based authentication.
However, it can be manually invoked if the need arises.

Once enabled, the `/auth/v1/method/github` API prefix is mounted to Flipt's API.
This section of the API supports a GitHub's OAuth 2.0 flow.

This will lead to the following endpoints being available on Flipt:

- `GET /auth/v1/method/github/authorize`
- `GET /auth/v1/method/github/callback`

These two endpoints are necessary to support the different legs of the OAuth flow.
The first can be requested to obtain an authorization URL directed at GitHub.
The latter is the destination that GitHub will redirect the client back to.
When using HTTP, this callback endpoint will establish a cookie named `flipt_client_token` and return it via the `Set-Cookie` response header.

## Kubernetes

<Note>
This method is designed for automatically authenticating applications with Flipt.

We're actively designing and developing client-side implementations to leverage this method seamlessly.
However, for now, the API must be managed manually by your implementation.

</Note>

The `kubernetes` authentication method supports the ability to exchange [Kubernetes service account](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/service-accounts) tokens with Flipt for client tokens.
This allows services deployed into the same Kubernetes cluster as Flipt to automatically gain authenticated access to the Flipt API without additional management of static client tokens.

![Kubernetes Authentication Flow](/images/authentication/kubernetes.svg)

When enabled (see our [Configuration: Method Kubernetes](/configuration/authentication#method-kubernetes) documentation) a service deployed within Kubernetes can read their service account token from local disk and invoke the verify service account operation on the API.
Given the service account is deemed valid for the surrounding cluster this operation will return a valid Flipt client token with a matching expiration as the service account.
If your Kubernetes environment has short-lived service account tokens, care will be needed to periodically request a new client token using a newly issued service account token.

<Tip>
  Kubernetes refreshes service account tokens locally, all that's required is to
  read the token from the disk again.
</Tip>

The client token produced can be used in subsequent API requests with the rest of the Flipt API to gain authenticated access.

### Via the API

The following can be issued from inside a pod with a valid service account token in the default location for Kubernetes.
It assumes that Flipt is reachable and deployed in the same cluster with a service name of `flipt`.

<CodeGroup>
```bash client-token.sh
# assumes both curl and jq are installed
curl -s -X POST http://flipt:8080/auth/v1/method/kubernetes/serviceaccount \
  --data "{\"service_account_token\":\"$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token)\"}" | \
  jq .

    "metadata": {
      "io.flipt.auth.k8s.namespace": "default",
      "io.flipt.auth.k8s.pod.name": "someservice-586bfb5b6b-fmh8g",
      "io.flipt.auth.k8s.pod.uid": "b5217947-aeac-4b35-afd3-23f50d63eae9",

      "io.flipt.auth.k8s.serviceaccount.uid": "8aeb28ad-66f0-4884-bafc-e606e5eda149"
    }
  }
}
```

```go client_http.go
package client

import (
	"fmt"
	"encoding/json"
	"net/http"
	"os"
)

type Response struct {
	ClientToken    string `json:"clientToken"`
	Authentication struct {
		ExpiresAt time.Time `json:"expiresAt"`
	} `json:"authentication"`
}

func getClientToken(ctx context.Context) (*Response, error) {
	saToken, err := os.ReadFile("/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token")
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	req, err := http.NewRequestWithContext(
		ctx,
		http.MethodPost,
		"http://flipt:8080/auth/v1/method/kubernetes/serviceaccount",
		map[string]string{
			"service_account_token": saToken,
		})
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	resp, err := http.Do(req)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	defer resp.Body.Close()

	if resp.Status != http.StatusOK {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("unexpected status code: %q", resp.Status)
	}

	response := &Response{}
	if err := json.NewDecoder(resp.Body).Decode(response); err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	return response, nil
}
```

</CodeGroup>

The client token found in the body of the response can be used in the authentication bearer header, as outlined in [Using Client Tokens](/authentication/using-tokens).
The expiration can be used to schedule when to next request a new client token.
