## Metrics

Flipt exposes [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics at the `/metrics`
HTTP endpoint. To see which metrics are currently supported, point your browser
to `FLIPT_HOST/metrics` (ex: `localhost:8080/metrics`).

You should see a bunch of metrics being recorded such as:

```yaml
flipt_cache_hit_total{cache="memory",type="flag"} 1
flipt_cache_miss_total{cache="memory",type="flag"} 1
---
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0"} 8.641e-06
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.25"} 2.499e-05
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.5"} 3.5359e-05
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.75"} 6.6594e-05
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="1"} 0.00026651 go_gc_duration_seconds_sum
0.000402094 go_gc_duration_seconds_count 5
```

An [example](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/tree/main/examples/metrics)
showing how to set up Flipt with Prometheus can be found in the GitHub repository.

### Dashboards

![Grafana Dashboard](/images/configuration/grafana_flag_dashboard.png)

We provide a set of [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboards that you can use to visualize the metrics collected by Flipt, including both server health and flag evaluation metrics.

You can find the dashboards in our [grafana-dashboards](https://github.com/flipt-io/grafana-dashboards) repository.

## Tracing

Flipt supports distributed tracing via the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) project.

Currently, we support the following tracing backends:

- [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/)
- [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/)
- [OTLP](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/protocol/).

Enable tracing via the values described in the [Tracing configuration](/configuration/overview#tracing) and point Flipt to your configured collector to record spans.

[Examples](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/tree/main/examples/tracing) showing how to set up Flipt with each of the supported tracing backends can be found in the main GitHub repository .

### OTLP

OTLP supports additional configuration such as specifying the protocol to use (gRPC or HTTP) as well as providing custom headers to send with the request.

Custom headers can be used to provide authentication information to the collector which may be required if you are using a hosted collector such as [NewRelic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/get-started/opentelemetry-set-up-your-app/), [DataDog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/opentelemetry/otlp_ingest_in_the_agent/?tab=host), or [Honeycomb](https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-data-in/opentelemetry-overview/#instrumenting-with-opentelemetry).

These can be configured via the `tracing.otlp` configuration section.

```yaml
tracing:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "https://{your-collector-url}"
    headers:
      "X-Some-Header": "some-value"
```

## Audit Events

Flipt supports sending audit events to configured sinks. Audit events have the following structure:

```json
{
  "version": "0.1",
  "type": "flag",
  "action": "created",
  "metadata": {
    "actor": {
      "authentication": "none",
      "ip": "172.17.0.1"
    }
  },
  "payload": {
    "description": "flipt flag",
    "enabled": true,
    "key": "flipt",
    "name": "flipt",
    "namespace_key": "default"
  },
  "timestamp": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

- `version` : the version of the audit event structure. We don't expect too many changes to the structure of the audit event
- `type` : the type of the entity being acted upon (flag, variant, constraint, etc.)
- `action` : the action taken upon the entity (created, deleted, updated, etc.)
- `metadata` : extra information related to the audit event as a whole. The `actor` field will always be present containing some identity information of the source which initiated the audit event
- `payload` : the actual payload used to interact with the `Flipt` server for certain auditable events
- `timestamp`: the time the event was created

Currently, we support the following sinks for audit events:

- Log File: the audit events are JSON encoded and new-line delimited. You can find the configuration in the [Audit Events - Log File](/configuration/overview#audit-events-log-file) section of the Configuration documentation.
- Webhook: the audit events are sent to a URL of your choice. You can find the configuration in the [Audit Events - Webhook](/configuration/overview#audit-events-webhook) section of the Configuration documentation.

You can find [examples](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/tree/main/examples/audit) in the main GitHub repository on how to enable audit events and how to tune configuration for it.

### Event Filtering

Starting from [v1.27.0](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/releases/tag/v1.27.0), you can specify configuration for which events you would like to receive on your audit sink.

An always up to date list of events supported is available in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/blob/main/internal/server/audit/README.md).

Events are specified in the format of `noun:verb`. You can also specify a wild card for either the noun or the verb. For instance `*:created` corresponds to all `created` events for every entity. Furthermore, `flag:*` corresponds to all `flag` events, and `*:*` corresponds to every single event.

Examples of configuring events include:

```
flag:created
namespace:created
flag:*
rollout:deleted
rule:deleted
*:updated
```

### Webhooks

You can opt to receive audit events as an HTTP POST to a configured webhook.

Below is an example HTTP POST request made to a webhook URL:

```console
POST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 275
Accept-Encoding: gzip
Content-Type: application/json
X-Forwarded-For: 136.54.97.144
X-Forwarded-Proto: https

{
  "version": "0.1",
  "type": "flag",
  "action": "updated",
  "metadata": {
    "actor": {
      "authentication": "none",
      "ip": "127.0.0.1"
    }
  },
  "payload": {
    "description": "",
    "enabled": true,
    "key": "maintenance-mode",
    "name": "Maintenance Mode",
    "namespace_key": "default"
  },
  "timestamp": "2023-09-13T13:05:18-04:00"
}
```

You also have the ability to provide a signing secret for requests to your webhook. If you specify a signing secret, you will receive a request with the `X-Flipt-Webhook-Signature` header populated.

The value in the header is the request body HMAC sha256 signed with the signing secret you specified. On the webhook server, you can validate the signature by using the same signing secret. It is _strongly recommended_ that you do this to prevent requests to your webhook server that are from invalid origins.

#### Webhook Templates

Starting from [v1.28.0](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/releases/tag/v1.28.0), you can specify a template for the body of an Audit Event Webhook request.

A sample configuration can look something like this:

```yaml
audit:
  sinks:
    webhook:
      enabled: true
      templates:
        - url: https://example.com
          headers:
            Content-Type: application/json
            Authorization: Bearer this-is-a-seret-token
          body: |
            {
              "type": {{ .Type }},
              "action": {{ .Action }}
            }
```

This configuration tells Flipt to send a `POST` request when events need to be emitted to the URL `https://example.com` with the HTTP headers, `Content-Type` and `Authorization`, and the body which is a [Go template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) that will be executed when an event comes in. The event structure looks like this:

```go
type Event struct {
	Version string `json:"version"`
	Type    Type   `json:"type"`
	Action  Action `json:"action"`

	Metadata Metadata `json:"metadata"`

	Payload interface{} `json:"payload"`

	Timestamp string `json:"timestamp"`
}
```

Any of the values that are [exposed](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/blob/v1.28.0/internal/server/audit/audit.go#L51-L61) by Flipt are fair game for inclusion in your HTTP body template.
