## Telemetry

Flipt developers rely on anonymous usage data to help prioritize new features
and improve the product. The information collected is completely anonymous,
never shared with external entities, and you can opt-out at any time.

### What Kind of Data is Collected?

- Flipt version

You can view the full schema of the telemetry data on
[GitHub](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/blob/05b85f6ec704d9eac850984c16d9bc3d15dbdb6c/internal/telemetry/telemetry.go#L26-L30).

We use [Segment](https://segment.com) to collect the data. Only the creator of
Flipt has access to the data.

### How to Disable Telemetry

There are multiple ways in which you can disable telemetry collection:

#### Configuration File

```yaml
meta:
  telemetry_enabled: false
```

#### Environment Variable

```yaml
export FLIPT_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
```

## Metrics

Flipt exposes [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics at the `/metrics`
HTTP endpoint. To see which metrics are currently supported, point your browser
to `FLIPT_HOST/metrics` (ex: `localhost:8080/metrics`).

You should see a bunch of metrics being recorded such as:

```yaml
flipt_cache_hit_total{cache="memory",type="flag"} 1
flipt_cache_miss_total{cache="memory",type="flag"} 1
---
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0"} 8.641e-06
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.25"} 2.499e-05
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.5"} 3.5359e-05
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.75"} 6.6594e-05
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="1"} 0.00026651 go_gc_duration_seconds_sum
0.000402094 go_gc_duration_seconds_count 5
```

There is an
[example](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/tree/main/examples/prometheus)
provided in the GitHub repository showing how to set up Flipt with Prometheus.

### Dashboards

![Grafana Dashboard](/images/configuration/grafana_flag_dashboard.png)

We have created a set of [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboards that you can use to visualize the metrics collected by Flipt, including both server health and flag evaluation metrics.

You can find the dashboards in our [grafana-dashboards](https://github.com/flipt-io/grafana-dashboards) repository.

## Tracing

Flipt supports distributed tracing via the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) project.

Currently, we support the following tracing backends:

- [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/)
- [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/)
- [OTLP](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/protocol/).

Enable tracing via the values described in the [Tracing configuration](/configuration/overview#tracing) and point Flipt to your configured collector to record spans.

There are [examples](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/tree/main/examples/tracing) provided in the main GitHub repository showing how to set up Flipt with each of the supported tracing backends.

## Audit Events

Starting from `v1.21.0`, Flipt supports sending audit events to configured sinks. Audit events have the following structure:

```json
{
  "version": "v0.1",
  "metadata": {
    "type": "flag",
    "action": "created",
    "ip": "127.0.0.1",
    "author": "joe@example.com"
  },
  "payload": {
    "description": "audit events feature",
    "enabled": true,
    "key": "my-audit-event",
    "name": "myauditevent",
    "namespace_key": "default"
  }
}
```

- `version` : describes the version of the audit event structure. We do not expect too many changes to the structure of the audit event
- `metadata`: information concerning the `type` and `action` taken with some identity metadata, `ip` and optional `author` if applicable
- `payload` : the actual payload used to interact with the `Flipt` server for certain auditable events


Currently, we support the following sinks for audit events:

- Log File: the audit events are JSON encoded and new-line delimited

You can find [examples]() on the main GitHub repository on how to enable audit events, and how to tune configuration for it.
