## Analytics

Since [v1.37.0](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/releases/tag/v1.37.0) Flipt includes functionality for reporting analytical data to a configurable storage engine.

Currently, Flipt has support for collecting data into:

- [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com/)

The data that gets collected currently includes:

- Flag Evaluation Count

Once a storage backend is configured, these analytics are viewable in the UI allowing users to visualize up to 24 hours of data for each metric.

The image above shows the past 30 minutes of the flag `flag1` evaluation counts.

## Considerations

### Database

We highly **recommend** using a separate database for analytics produced by Flipt. This ensures that Flipt analytic data can be logically isolated from the rest of your Clickhouse data.

<Note>
  The analytics database must be created before Flipt will be able to write
  analytical data and run any migrations. See our
  [migration](/configuration/storage#migrations) section for more info.
</Note>

### Origin of Analytics

Analytics are currently only collected as they pass through the evaluation server. This means that analytics will be captured if you are using the REST or GRPC APIs via one of our [Server SDKs](/integration/server/rest) or [GRPC SDKs](/integration/server/grpc) for evaluations.

We have plans to support collecting analytics for [Client-Side](/integration/client) evaluations in the future.
