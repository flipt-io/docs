## Relational Database

Flipt supports [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) and [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/) relational databases.

<Note>
  As of [v1.29.0](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/releases/tag/v1.29.0), Flipt
  also supports [libSQL](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql) which is a
  fork of SQLite that can be accessed over a network via
  [sqld](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql/tree/main/libsql-server).
</Note>

SQLite is enabled by default for simplicity, however, you should use PostgreSQL, MySQL, or CockroachDB if you intend to run multiple copies of Flipt in a high availability configuration.

The database connection can be configured as follows:

### SQLite

<Note>
  The default location of the SQLite database is `/var/opt/flipt/flipt.db` on
  Linux and `~/Library/Application Support/flipt/flipt.db` on macOS (since
  v1.26.0).
</Note>

```yaml
db:
  # file: informs flipt to use SQLite
  url: file:/var/opt/flipt/flipt.db
```

### LibSQL

See our [libSQL Example](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/blob/main/examples/database/libsql) for a working example of how to use libSQL with Flipt.

#### Local

```yaml
db:
  # libsql: informs flipt to use libSQL
  url: libsql://file:/var/opt/flipt/flipt.db
```

#### Remote

<Note>
  If using [Turso](https://turso.tech/) you must use a [database auth
  token](https://docs.turso.tech/reference/turso-cli#creating-a-database-token)
  to access the database.
</Note>

```yaml
db: # http(s): informs flipt to use libSQL over HTTP(s) via sqld/Turso
  url: https://db-[your-github-name].turso.io?authToken=[your-auth-token]
```

### PostgreSQL

```yaml
db:
  url: postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/flipt?sslmode=disable
```

### CockroachDB

```yaml
db:
  url: cockroach://root@localhost:26257/flipt?sslmode=disable
```

### MySQL

```yaml
db:
  url: mysql://mysql@localhost:3306/flipt
```

### Migrations

From time to time the Flipt database must be updated with new schema. To
accomplish this, Flipt includes a `migrate` command that will run any pending
database migrations for you.

If Flipt is started and there are pending migrations, you will see the following
error in the console:

```yaml
migrations pending, please backup your database and run `flipt migrate`
```

If it's your first run of Flipt, all migrations will automatically be run
before starting the Flipt server.

<Warning>
  You should backup your database before running `flipt migrate` to ensure that
  no data is lost if an error occurs during migration.
</Warning>

If running Flipt via Docker, you can run the migrations in a separate container
before starting Flipt by running:

```yaml
docker run -it -v $HOME/flipt:/var/opt/flipt flipt/flipt:latest /bin/sh -c './flipt migrate'
```

<Note>
  `$HOME/flipt` is just used as an example, you can use any directory you would
  like on the host.
</Note>

If you don't use mounted volumes to persist your data, your data will be lost
when the migration container exits, having no effect on your Flipt instance!

## Declarative

The following backend types are designed to support declarative management of feature flag state via a well-known file format.
In particular, they're designed to support GitOps practices with minimal external dependencies.

Currently, we classify `local`, `git`, `object` and `oci` as the four declarative backends.
The `local` backend has been primarily developed to support a local development experience,
whereas, the `git`, `object` and `oci` backends are intended for production use.

### Read Only Mode

![Read Only Mode](/images/configuration/readonly.png)

Once enabled, all filesystem backends put the Flipt API and UI into a `read-only` mode that prevents Flipt from writing to the backend. This is useful for production environments where you want to ensure that flag state is only managed via the configured backend.

<Tip>
You can also put Flipt into `read-only` mode by setting the `FLIPT_STORAGE_READ_ONLY` environment variable to `true`, or setting `storage.read_only` to `true` in your configuration.
</Tip>

### Local

The purpose of this backend type is to support serving Flipt flag state directly from your local filesystem.
You can simply specify a relative or absolute directory in order to start a local Flipt instance and serve flag state.
This is particularly useful for local development and validation of flag state changes.

Flipt will periodically rebuild its state from the local disk every 10 seconds.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Environment Variable">

    ```bash
    FLIPT_STORAGE_TYPE="local"
    FLIPT_STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH="."
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Configuration Yaml">

    ```yaml
    storage:
      type: local
      local:
        path: "."
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Git

The `git` type backend is used to configure a target Git repository and Git reference to source feature flag state.
The configuration contains fields for addressing the repository, configuring the target reference as well as adding authentication credentials.

Once a target repository and reference are configured, Flipt will poll the source repository on a periodic cadence.
This cadence is also configurable and defaults to 30 seconds.

Flipt will follow the configured reference (e.g. branch name) and keep up to date with new changes.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Environment Variable">

    ```bash
    FLIPT_STORAGE_TYPE="git"
    FLIPT_STORAGE_GIT_REPOSITORY="https://github.com/predictab.le/config.git"
    FLIPT_STORAGE_GIT_REF="main"
    FLIPT_STORAGE_GIT_POLL_INTERVAL="30s"
    # for private repository access
    FLIPT_STORAGE_GIT_AUTHENTICATION_BASIC_USERNAME=...
    FLIPT_STORAGE_GIT_AUTHENTICATION_BASIC_PASSWORD=...
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Configuration Yaml">

    ```yaml
    storage:
      type: git
      git:
        repository: "https://github.com/predictab.le/config.git"
        ref: "main"
        poll_interval: "30s"
        authentication:
          basic:
            username: ...
            password: ...
          token:
            access_token: ...
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Authentication

Authentication enables the ability to leverage private Git repositories as flag state backends.
The `git` type backend supports both `basic`, `token` and `ssh` based authentication schemes.

**GitHub**

<Note>
  When using GitHub and their [PATs (Personal Access
  Tokens)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens),
  `basic` authentication should be used. GitHub expects you to supply a valid
  `username` and provide your PAT as the `password` parameter.
</Note>

```yaml
storage:
  type: git
  git:
    repository: "https://github.com/predictab.le/config.git"
    ref: "main"
    poll_interval: "30s"
    authentication:
      basic:
        username: < username >
        password: < github-personal-access-token >
```

**SSH**

In order to configure Flipt with SSH, you will need to generate an SSH key-pair and configure your repository provider with the public key.
GitHub has some excellent documentation regarding how to generate and install you credentials [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

Once you have your private key credentials you will need to configure Flipt to use them.
This can be done via the `storage.git.authentication.ssh` configuration section:

```yaml
storage:
  type: git
  git:
    repository: git@github.com:flipt-io/some-private-repo.git
    authentication:
      ssh:
        password: flipt
        private_key_path: private-key.pem
        # private_key_bytes: <raw-key-bytes> # alternatively pass the raw bytes inline
        insecure_ignore_host_key: true
```

<Warning>
  `insecure_ignore_host_key` is not encouraged for production use, and is
  `false` by default. Instead, you are advised to put the key fingerprint in the
  known hosts file where you are running Flipt. For example, for Github you can
  do `ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts` on the Flipt host.
</Warning>

See our [GitOps Guide](/guides/get-going-with-gitops) for an example of how to set up a GitHub repository as a flag state backend.

### Object

The object storage type supports using a hosted object storage service as the source of truth for Flipt state configuration.
Currently, Flipt supports the [S3 API](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) as a backend. This means the AWS S3 and open-source alternatives such as [Minio](https://github.com/minio/minio) can be leveraged as Flipt backends.

The contents of a target object storage bucket must contain Flipt state configuration files.
As with the `git` and `local` backend types, the same rules apply with regard to how Flipt will locate feature flag state in your target bucket.

Check out the section below on [Flag State Configuration](#flag-state-configuration) for how Flipt decides which files in a target are considered for serving flag state.
With the object storage backend, Flipt will respect a file at the root of the target with the name `.flipt.yml` to serve as an index for locating flag state configuration in the bucket.
It will also use the same default strategy when the index isn't supplied (e.g. file name `features.yml` or `*.features.yml`).

#### S3

The S3 backend can be configured to serve state from a single bucket from a target S3-compatible API.

The following is an example of how to configure Flipt to leverage this backend type:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Environment Variable">

    ```bash
    FLIPT_STORAGE_TYPE="object"
    FLIPT_STORAGE_OBJECT_TYPE="s3"
    FLIPT_STORAGE_OBJECT_S3_REGION="us-east-1"
    FLIPT_STORAGE_OBJECT_S3_BUCKET="flipt_feature_flags"
    FLIPT_STORAGE_OBJECT_S3_POLL_INTERVAL="1m"
    # optional bucket prefix for locating flag state files
    FLIPT_STORAGE_OBJECT_S3_PREFIX="production"
    # for non-AWS hosted S3
    FLIPT_STORAGE_OBJECT_S3_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9009
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Configuration Yaml">

    ```yaml
    storage:
      type: object
      object:
        type: s3
        s3:
          region: us-east-1
          bucket: flipt_feature_flags
          poll_interval: "30s"
          # optional bucket prefix for locating flag state files
          prefix: production
          # for non-AWS hosted S3
          endpoint: http://localhost:9009
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

In addition to these Flipt configuration parameters, credentials will also be required for Flipt to authenticate with the target object-store.
These should be provided as environment variables to the Flipt server process:

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
```

### OCI

Since `v1.31.0`, Flipt supports using any [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) compatible registry as a declarative backend source.
Flipt has its own custom OCI manifest format (we call them `bundles`), which can be built and managed using the [Flipt CLI](/cli/commands/bundle).

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Environment Variable">

    ```bash
    FLIPT_STORAGE_TYPE="oci"
    FLIPT_STORAGE_OCI_REPOSITORY="some.oci.registry/repository/image:tag"
    FLIPT_STORAGE_OCI_POLL_INTERVAL="30s"
    # authentication credentials
    FLIPT_STORAGE_OCI_AUTHENTICATION_USERNAME="username"
    FLIPT_STORAGE_OCI_AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD="password"
    # location used for storing local bundles
    FLIPT_STORAGE_OCI_BUNDLES_DIRECTORY="<user_config_dir>/flipt/bundles"
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Configuration Yaml">

    ```yaml
    storage:
      type: "oci"
      oci:
        repository: "some.oci.registry/repository/image:tag"
        poll_interval: "30s"
        authentication:
          username: "username"
          password: "password"
        bundles_directory: "<user_config_dir>/flipt/bundles"
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Flag State Configuration

Each of Flipt's filesystem backends expects you to represent your feature flag configuration via a set of YAML files.
These files declaratively define what flags, segments, variants, etc. exist and in what configuration.

#### Locating Flag State

Flipt's filesystem backends allow you to define feature flags alongside other configurations in a shared directory, repository, or object storage bucket.

Flipt uses a naming scheme to index which files are flag state files. By default, Flipt will look for the following filename patterns to attempt to parse as Flipt state:

- `**/features.yaml`
- `**/features.yml`
- `**/*.features.yaml`
- `**/*.features.yml`

Any file named `features.yaml`, `features.yml`, or with either extension `.features.yaml` or `.features.yml` is considered recursively from the root of your target.

If this naming convention doesn't work for you, it can be overridden by creating a file named `.flipt.yml` in the root of your target directory tree. This file will be used to instruct Flipt on how to index your directory tree and find flag state files:

```yaml
version: "1.0"
include:
  - "**/features.yaml"
  - "**/features.yml"
  - "**/*.features.yaml"
  - "**/*.features.yml"
exclude: []
```

The index file contains two lists `include` and `exclude`. These can contain specific paths or glob-matching patterns.
The indexing process first matches the `include` section and then filters that are set by the `exclude` section.

#### Defining Flag State

<Info>

Flipt flag state file format has been taken directly from Flipt's existing
[import and export](/operations/import-export) flag state format.

You can run `flipt export` on your existing Flipt instance, and then
add/commit the result to a directory, object storage, or Git repository to get started.

This can be used to migrate from a relational database-backed instance of Flipt to a filesystem-backed deployment with ease.

</Info>

```yaml features.yaml
namespace: backend
flags:
  - key: awesomeNewFeature
    name: Awesome New Feature
    enabled: true
    variants:
      - key: enabled
        name: Enabled
      - key: disabled
        name: Disabled
    rules:
      - segment: internal-users
        distributions:
          - variant: enabled
            rollout: 100
      - segment: all-users
        distributions:
          - variant: enabled
            rollout: 20
          - variant: disabled
            rollout: 80

segments:
  - key: internal-users
    name: Internal Users
    constraints:
      - type: STRING_COMPARISON_TYPE
        property: organization
        operator: eq
        value: internal
    match_type: ALL_MATCH_TYPE
  - key: all-users
    name: All Users
    match_type: ALL_MATCH_TYPE
```

Each file identified for use by Flipt represents the contents of a single namespace.
Multiple namespaces can be defined across multiple files.
You can organize these files however you like in your target directory.

<Tip>
  By defining different namespaces in different directories, you can leverage
  features such as GitHub's Codeowners. This gives you authorization mechanisms
  for managing contributions to Flipt state.
</Tip>

The file format currently consists of four top-level keys:

```yaml
version: "1.0" # a version for this file format
namespace: default # string identifying the resources collective namespace
flags: [] # [Flag] list of Flag definitions
segments: [] # [Segment] list of Segment definitions
```

## Caching

Flipt supports both in-memory cache as well as [Redis](https://redis.io/) to enable faster reads and
evaluations. Enabling caching has been shown to speed up read performance by
several orders of magnitude.

<Warning>
  Enabling in-memory caching when running more than one instance of Flipt isn't
  advised as it may lead to unpredictable results. It's recommended to use Redis
  instead if you are running more than one instance of Flipt.
</Warning>

Caching works as follows:

- All flag reads and evaluation requests go through the cache
- Flag cache entries are purged whenever a write to a flag or its variants
  occur or the TTL expires
- Evaluation cache entries are purged after the TTL expires only
- A cache miss will fetch the item from the database and add the item to the
  cache for the next read
- A cache hit will simply return the item from the cache, not interacting with
  the database

See the [Cache](/configuration/overview#cache) section for how to configure caching.

### Expiration/Eviction

You can also configure an optional duration at which items in the cache are
marked as expired.

For example, if you set the cache TTL to `5m`, items that have been in the cache
for longer than 5 minutes will be marked as expired, meaning the next read for
that item will hit the database.

Setting an eviction interval (in-memory cache only) will automatically remove
expired items from your cache at a defined period.

<Note>
  The combination of cache expiration and eviction can help lessen the amount of
  memory your cache uses, as infrequently accessed items will be removed over
  time.
</Note>

To tune the expiration and eviction interval of the cache set the following in
your configuration:

```yaml
cache:
  enabled: true
  backend: memory
  ttl: 5m # items older than 5 minutes will be marked as expired
  memory:
    eviction_interval: 2m # expired items will be evicted from the cache every 2 minutes
```
