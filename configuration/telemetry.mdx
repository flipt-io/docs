## Telemetry

Flipt developers rely on anonymous usage data to help prioritize new features
and improve the product. The information collected is completely anonymous,
never shared with external entities, and you can opt-out at any time.

### What Kind of Data is Collected?

- Flipt version (ie: v1.20.0)
- Database backend (ie: Postgres)
- Cache backend (ie: Redis)
- Authentication methods (ie: OIDC)

We use [Segment](https://segment.com) to collect the data. Only the creator of
Flipt has access to the raw data.

Here is an example of the telemetry data sent to Segment:

```json
{
    "version": "1.1",
    "uuid": "1545d8a8-7a66-4d8d-a158-0a1c576c68a6",
    "lastTimestamp": "2023-04-25T01:01:51Z",
    "flipt": {
        "version": "v1.20.1",
        "storage": {
            "database": "postgres",
            "cache": "redis"
        },
        "authentication": {
            "methods": "oidc"
        }
    }
}
```

You can view the full schema of the telemetry data on
[GitHub](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/blob/05b85f6ec704d9eac850984c16d9bc3d15dbdb6c/internal/telemetry/telemetry.go#L26-L30).


### How to Disable Telemetry

There are multiple ways in which you can disable telemetry collection:

#### Configuration File

```yaml
meta:
  telemetry_enabled: false
```

#### Environment Variable

```yaml
export FLIPT_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
```
