## Introduction

From time to time, we may introduce new features that are not yet ready for general availability. These features are considered experimental and may change or be removed in future releases. We encourage you to try these features and provide feedback to help us improve them.

## Enabling Experimental Features

These features are disabled by default. To enable them, you can set the `experimental.{feature}.enabled` configuration option to `true` in your Flipt [configuration file](/configuration/overview#configuration-file).

For example to enable the `foo` experimental feature:

```yaml config.yaml
experimental:
  foo:
    enabled: true
```

<Tip>
  You can also enable experimental features using [environment
  variables](/configuration/overview#environment-variables). For example, to enable the `foo`
  experimental feature, you can set the `FLIPT_EXPERIMENTAL_FOO_ENABLED`
  environment variable to `true`.
</Tip>

## Current Experimental Features

The following is a list of our current experimental features and a brief description of each.

<Note>
  Make sure you have the [latest
  version](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/releases/latest) of the Flipt CLI
  installed on your local machine.
</Note>

## Deprecations

Once an experimental feature is promoted to a stable feature or is removed, it will move to a deprecated status. Depending on the feature, you may need to take action to migrate to the new stable feature or remove the deprecated feature from your configuration.

If an enabled experimental feature has been deprecated, you will see a warning message in the CLI output when you start the Flipt server, such as:

```bash
Warning: 'experimental.filesystem_storage' has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
```
