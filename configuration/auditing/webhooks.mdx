You can opt to receive audit events as an HTTP POST to a configured webhook.

Below is an example HTTP POST request made to a webhook URL:

```console
POST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 275
Accept-Encoding: gzip
Content-Type: application/json
X-Forwarded-For: 136.54.97.144
X-Forwarded-Proto: https

{
  "version": "0.1",
  "type": "flag",
  "action": "updated",
  "metadata": {
    "actor": {
      "authentication": "none",
      "ip": "127.0.0.1"
    }
  },
  "payload": {
    "description": "",
    "enabled": true,
    "key": "maintenance-mode",
    "name": "Maintenance Mode",
    "namespace_key": "default"
  },
  "timestamp": "2023-09-13T13:05:18-04:00"
}
```

## Automatic Retries

If the webhook server returns a non-200 response, Flipt will retry sending the request using an exponential backoff strategy until a maximum elapsed duration. The default maximum elapsed duration is 15 seconds.

You can configure the maximum duration using the following configuration:

```yaml
audit:
  sinks:
    webhook:
      max_backoff_duration: 15s
```

See the [Audit Events - Webhook](/configuration/overview#audit-events-webhook) section of the configuration documentation for more details.

## Security

You may provide a signing secret for requests to your webhook. If you specify a signing secret, you will receive a request with the `X-Flipt-Webhook-Signature` header populated. This value can be set in the [Audit Events - Webhook](/configuration/overview#audit-events-webhook) section of the Flipt server configuration.

The value in the `X-Flipt-Webhook-Signature` header is the request body HMAC SHA256 signed with the signing secret you specified. On the webhook server, you can validate the signature by using the same signing secret. It's _strongly recommended_ that you do this to prevent requests to your webhook server that are from invalid origins.

## Templates

Starting from [v1.28.0](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/releases/tag/v1.28.0), you can specify a template for the body of an Audit Event Webhook request.

A sample configuration can look something like this:

```yaml
audit:
  sinks:
    webhook:
      enabled: true
      templates:
        - url: https://example.com
          headers:
            Content-Type: application/json
            Authorization: Bearer this-is-a-seret-token
          body: |
            {
              "type": "{{ .Type }}",
              "action": "{{ .Action }}"
              "payload": {{ toJson .Payload }}
            }
```

<Note>
  As of [v1.39.0](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/releases/tag/v1.39.0), the
  Go template contains a `toJson` utility method that will transform an input
  into JSON if it fits the structure.
</Note>

This configuration tells Flipt to send a `POST` request when events need to be emitted to the URL `https://example.com` with the HTTP headers, `Content-Type` and `Authorization`, and the body which is a [Go template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) that will be executed when an event comes in. The event structure looks like this:

```go
type Event struct {
	Version string `json:"version"`
	Type    Type   `json:"type"`
	Action  Action `json:"action"`

	Metadata Metadata `json:"metadata"`

	Payload interface{} `json:"payload"`

	Timestamp string `json:"timestamp"`
}
```

Any of the values that are [exposed](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/blob/v1.28.0/internal/server/audit/audit.go#L51-L61) by Flipt are available for inclusion in your HTTP body template.

### Example: Slack

Below is an example of a Slack webhook integration that uses the templating feature to send a Slack message when a flag is updated.

````yaml
audit:
  sinks:
    webhook:
      enabled: true
      templates:
        - url: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxxxx"
          headers:
            Content-Type: "application/json"
          body: |
            {
              "text": "Flipt Event: {{ .Type }}/{{ .Action }}\n\n```{{ .Payload }}```"
            }
````

The above configuration will send a Slack message that looks like this:
