description: This document describes how to configure Flipt's authorization mechanisms.
---

<Warning>
Flipt authorization is **experimental** and **disabled** (not required) by default.

To enable authorization, you must set the `experimental.authorization.enabled` configuration option to `true` in your Flipt [configuration file](/configuration/overview#configuration-file).

Once authorization has been set to `required: true` all management API routes will require a valid authentication session as well.

The UI will require a session-compatible authentication method (e.g. [OIDC](/authentication/methods#openid-connect)) to be enabled.

</Warning>

Flipt supports the ability to secure its core API routes by setting the `required` field to `true` on the `authorization` configuration object.

```yaml config.yaml
authorization:
  required: true

# required while authorization is still experimental
experimental:
  authorization:
    enabled: true
```

When authorization is set to `required`, the API will ensure valid credentials are present on all management API requests.

See the [Authorization: Overview](/authorization/overview) documentation for more details on Flipt's API authorization handling.

## Policies

Flipt uses [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) to enforce authorization policies. OPA is a general-purpose policy engine that can be used to enforce policies across the stack.

### Local

Currently, Flipt only supports local policy files. These policy files must be valid [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/) files.

<Note>
  In the future we plan to support other policy source backends such as git,
  object store, and others. If you have a specific use case, please get in
  touch!
</Note>

You can specify the path to the policy file in the `policy` object in the `authorization` configuration object.

```yaml
authorization:
  required: true
  policy:
    backend: local
    local:
      path: "policy.rego"
```

The policy **must** have the following package declaration:

```rego policy.rego
package flipt.authz.v1
```

You can learn more about policies in our [Authorization: Overview](/authorization/overview#policies) documentation.

### Polling Interval

Flipt will poll the policy file for changes at a regular interval. By default, Flipt will poll the policy file every 5 minutes. You can adjust this interval by setting the `poll_interval` field in the `policy` object.

```yaml
authorization:
  required: true
  policy:
    backend: local
    local:
      path: "policy.rego"
      poll_interval: "1m"
```

## External Data

In addition to policies that can be used to enforce authorization rules, Flipt also provides a way to pass external data to the policy evaluation.

This can be done by setting the `data` object in the `authorization` configuration object.

### Local

Currently, Flipt only supports local data objects. These data objects **must be valid JSON objects**.

<Note>
  In the future we plan to support other data source backends such as git,
  object store, and others. If you have a specific use case, please get in
  touch!
</Note>

You can specify the path to the data file in the `data` object in the `authorization` configuration object.

```yaml
authorization:
  required: true
  policy:
    backend: local
    local:
      path: "policy.rego"
  data:
    backend: local
    local:
      path: "data.json"
```

You can learn more about using data with policies in our [Authorization: Overview](/authorization/overview#external-data) documentation.

### Polling Interval

Like policies, Flipt will poll data files for changes at a regular interval. By default, Flipt will poll the data file every 30 seconds. You can adjust this interval by setting the `poll_interval` field in the `data` object.

```yaml
authorization:
  required: true
  data:
    backend: local
    local:
      path: "data.json"
      poll_interval: "1m"
```
