title: Authentication
description: This document describes how to configure Flipt's authentication mechanisms.
---

<Warning>
Once authentication has been set to `required: true` all API routes will require a client token to be present.

The UI will require a session-compatible authentication method (e.g. [OIDC](#method-oidc)) to be enabled.

</Warning>

Flipt supports the ability to secure its core API routes by setting the `required` field to `true` on the `authentication` configuration object.

```yaml config.yaml
authentication:
  required: true
```

When authentication is set to `required`, the API will ensure valid credentials are present on all API requests.

See the [Authentication: Overview](/authentication/overview) documentation for more details on Flipt's API authentication handling.

## Exclusions

Exclusions allow you to disable authentication for sections of the API.
The Flipt API is made of up of top-level API sections, each with its own unique prefix:

- `/api/v1` is the core feature flag state management section
- `/meta` describes the configuration of the running Flipt instance
- `/evaluate/v1` is the application facing flag state evaluation API

Each of these API sections can be optionally omitted from requiring authentication.
A common use case is to allow the evaluation API to be publicly accessible while still requiring authenticated users for managing feature-flag configuration and state.

By default, when authentication is configured as `required: true`, the effective configuration for the exclusions looks like this:

```yaml config.yaml
authentication:
  required: true
  exclude:
    management: false
    metadata: false
    evaluation: false
```

This means every part of the Flipt API is required for authentication.
However, taking the example from before, we could skip authentication for the evaluation section of the Flipt API like so:

```yaml config.yaml
authentication:
  required: true
  exclude:
    evaluation: true
```

## Session

This section contains common properties for establishing browser sessions via a "session compatible" authentication method. Session-compatible methods enable support for login in the UI. The methods below state whether or not they're session compatible (e.g. [OIDC](#method-oidc) is session compatible).

In order to establish a browser session over HTTP (via a `Cookie` header) some configuration is required.

```yaml config.yaml
authentication:
  session:
    domain: "flipt.yourorg.com"
    secure: true
    csrf:
      key: "some_secret_string"
```

When a "session compatible" authentication method is enabled the `domain` property is **required**.
It should be configured with the public domain your Flipt instance is hosted on.
The other properties aren't required to be explicitly configured.

To best secure your instance of Flipt, we advise that you run Flipt with `secure: true`.
This will require you to expose Flipt over HTTPS.
Additionally, we advise that you configure a `csrf.key` with a 32 or 64-byte random string of data.

```

## Methods

Each key within the `methods` section is a particular authentication method.
These methods are disabled (`enabled: false`) by default.
Enabling and configuring a method allows for different ways to establish client token credentials within Flipt.

### Method: Static Token

The `token` method provides the ability to create client tokens statically, with optional expiry constraints.

```yaml config.yaml
authentication:
  methods:
    token:
      enabled: true
      bootstrap:
        expiration: 24h
```

Once enabled, static tokens can be created via the [CreateToken](/reference/authentication/create-token) operation in the API.

Further explanation for using this method can be found in the [Authentication: Static Token](/authentication/methods#static-token) documentation.

### Method: OIDC

<Note>The `OIDC` method is a `session compatible` authentication method.</Note>

<Tip>
  Read our [Login with Google](/guides/login-with-google) guide for a more
  in-depth walk-through setting up an OIDC provider.
</Tip>

The `oidc` method provides the ability to establish client tokens via OAuth 2.0 with OIDC flow.
Once enabled and configured, the UI will automatically leverage it and present any configured providers as login options.

```yaml config.yaml
authentication:
  methods:
    oidc:
      enabled: true
      email_matches:
        - ^.*@flipt.io$
      providers:
        some_provider: # insert your provider name
          issuer_url: "https://some.oidc.issuer.com"
          client_id: "some_client_identifier"
          client_secret: "some_client_secret_credential"
          redirect_address: "https://your.flipt.instance.url.com"
          scopes:
            - email
            - profile
```

Multiple providers can be configured simultaneously.
Each will result in a Login option being presented in the UI, along with a separate endpoint being added in the API to support each provider flow.

!["OIDC Login"](../images/configuration/oidc_login.png)

Flipt has been tested with each of the following providers:

- [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect)
- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications/application-settings)
- [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/openid_connect_provider.html)
- [Dex](https://dexidp.io/docs/openid-connect/)
- [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/#oauth-2-0)

Though the intention is that it should work with other OIDC providers, these are just the handful the Flipt team has validated.

Following any of the links above should take you to the relevant documentation for each of these providers' OIDC client setups.
You can use the credentials and client configuration obtained using those steps as configuration for your Flipt instance.

#### Callback URL

When configuring your OIDC provider, you will need to provide a callback URL for the provider to redirect back to Flipt after a successful login.

The callback URL will be in the form of `https://your.flipt.instance.url.com/auth/v1/method/oidc/{provider}/callback`.

You can find the callback URL for each provider that you configure in your Flipt instance by querying the API.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://your.flipt.instance.url.com/auth/v1/method \
  --header 'Accept: application/json'
```

```json
{
  "methods": [
    {
      "method": "METHOD_TOKEN",
      "enabled": true,
      "sessionCompatible": false,
      "metadata": null
    },
    {
      "method": "METHOD_OIDC",
      "enabled": true,
      "sessionCompatible": true,
      "metadata": {
        "providers": {
          "google": {
            "authorize_url": "/auth/v1/method/oidc/google/authorize",
            "callback_url": "/auth/v1/method/oidc/google/callback"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Email Matches

Flipt operators may wish to lock down access to the Flipt API and UI to a specific group of users within their organization behind OIDC.
Since OIDC has the ability to retrieve email addresses, Flipt also provides a configuration option of using `email_matches` which are [regular expressions](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) that can be used to match against the OIDC email.

<Note>
  You must request the `email` scope from your OIDC provider in order for this
  feature to work.
</Note>

You can see an example of that above in the [sample configuration](#method-oidc).

#### PKCE

A good amount of OIDC providers support the PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) flow and the implicit OAuth flow. Flipt allows for a configuration to enable PKCE for all the legs of the OIDC authentication flow.

To enable this, you must set the [`use_pkce`](/configuration/overview#authentication-methods-oidc) property to `true` for each provider you would like to leverage PKCE with.

#### Example: OIDC With Google

<Tip>
  Checkout our new [Login with Google](/guides/login-with-google) guide for an
  in-depth look into configuring Google as an OIDC provider.
</Tip>

Given we're running our instance of Flipt on the public internet at `https://flipt.myorg.com`.

Using Google as an example and the documentation linked above, we obtained the following credentials for a Google OAuth client:

```yaml
client_id: "CyJcdvQMadOjSEx7ArArom0ytrbIHWd2Fb3N59oh8NQ="
client_secret: "WGgJmfQqN7cf17dFyZKXDL5S445/qhp+hfDAC0Mnl7oBrxgdAgiMyuwCkPiwfgQy"
```

We could create a provider definition in our configuration like so:

```yaml config.yaml
authentication:
  methods:
    oidc:
      enabled: true
      providers:
        google:
          issuer_url: "https://accounts.google.com"
          client_id: "CyJcdvQMadOjSEx7ArArom0ytrbIHWd2Fb3N59oh8NQ="
          client_secret: "WGgJmfQqN7cf17dFyZKXDL5S445/qhp+hfDAC0Mnl7oBrxgdAgiMyuwCkPiwfgQy"
          redirect_address: "https://flipt.myorg.com"
          scopes:
            - email
            - profile
```

<Note>
  The redirect URL for this provider would be
  `https://flipt.myorg.com/auth/v1/method/oidc/google/callback`.
</Note>

Additional `scopes` such as `profile` aren't 100% necessary, however, adding
them will result in Flipt being able to identify more details about your users
such as personalized greeting messages and user profile pictures in the UI.

Once this configuration has been enabled a `Login with Google` option will be presented in the UI.
Clicking this button will navigate the user to a Google consent screen.
Once the user has authenticated with Google, they will be redirected to the address defined in the `redirect_address` section of the provider configuration.

<Tip>
Google's consent screen can be configured to only accept accounts that are within your Google Workspace organization.

Other providers have similar mechanisms for attenuating who can leverage this authentication flow.

</Tip>

### Method: GitHub

<Note>
  The `GitHub` method is a `session compatible` authentication method.
</Note>

<Tip>
  Read our [Login with Github](/guides/login-with-github) guide for a more
  in-depth walk-through.
</Tip>

The `github` method provides the ability to establish client tokens via OAuth 2.0 with GitHub as the identity provider.
Once enabled and configured, the UI will automatically leverage it and present a "Login with GitHub" button.

```yaml config.yaml
authentication:
  methods:
    github:
      enabled: true
      client_id: "some_client_identifier"
      client_secret: "some_client_secret_credential"
      redirect_address: "https://your.flipt.instance.url.com"
      scopes:
        - user:email
```

!["GitHub Login"](../images/guides/login-with-github/login-with-github.png)

### Method: Kubernetes

The `kubernetes` method provides the ability to exchange Kubernetes service account tokens for client tokens.

```yaml config.yaml
authentication:
  methods:
    kubernetes:
      enabled: true
      discovery_url: https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local
      ca_path: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt
      service_account_token_path: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token
```

Once enabled, client tokens can be retrieved by sending a Kubernetes pod's service account token to the [VerifyServiceAccount](/reference/authentication/kubernetes-verify-service-account) operation in the API.

Further explanation for using this method can be found in the [Authentication: Kubernetes](/authentication/methods#kubernetes) documentation.

### Common Properties: Cleanup

Each authentication method contains a nested `cleanup` configuration object.
This object configures the periodic deletion of _expired_ authentications created with the associated method.

```yaml config.yaml
authentication:
  <method>:
    cleanup:
      interval: 10m
      grace_period: 24h
```

The cleanup object currently contains two keys `interval` and `grace_period`.
The `interval` is used to configure how frequently a delete _expired_ tokens action is performed.
Whereas, `grace_period` is used to ensure that _expired_ tokens are preserved for at least this configured duration.

This allows you to keep authentications around for auditing purposes after expiration.
Expired tokens are instances where the `expires_at` timestamp occurs before the current time.
The grace period is added onto this timestamp as a predicate when the delete operation is made.

Tokens that have expired (`expires_at` is before `now()`) will begin immediately failing authentication when presented as a credential to the API.
The `grace_period` is simply for the cleanup process.

## Reverse Proxy

You can secure Flipt simply by running it behind a reverse proxy in your own trusted environment.
An example of this can be found in [authentication examples](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/tree/main/examples/auth) in the Flipt repository.
