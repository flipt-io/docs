title: Getting Started
description: This document describes how to get started with Flipt.

Once you have your application integrated with the Flipt backend, it's time to
create some flags to evaluate. This document will walk you through creating your
first flag, segment, set of rules and finally using the debug console to
evaluate everything.

For more information on any of the concepts described here, please see the
[Concepts](/concepts) documentation.

## Setup

Before getting started, make sure the Flipt server is up and running on your
host on your chosen ports. See [Installation](/installation) for more.

In this example we'll use the default location of http://localhost:8080.

## Flags and Variants

First we'll create a flag and variants that we will use to evaluate against.

### Create a Flag

A flag is the basic entity in Flipt. Flags can represent features in your
applications that you want to enable/disable for your users.

To create a flag:

1. Open the UI at http://localhost:8080.
2. Click `New Flag`.
3. Populate the details of the flag as shown.
4. Click `Enabled` so the flag will be enabled once created.
5. Click `Create`.

You should see the message `Flag created!`.

### Create Variants

Variants allow you to return different values for your flags based on rules that
you define.

To create a variant:

1. On the Flag Details page for the new flag you created, click `New Variant`.
2. Populate the details of the variant as shown.
3. Click `Add Variant`.
4. Create one more variant populating the information as you wish.

!["Create Variant"](/images/01_create_variant-62ed2db0355f0aca50b5aeeacad36f61.png)

You should see the message `Variant added!`.

Click `Flags` in the navigation menu and you should now see your newly created
flag in the list.

## Segments and Constraints

Next we'll create a segment with a constraint that will be used to determine the
reach of your flag.

### Create a Segment

Segments are used to split your user base into subsets.

To create a segment:

1. From the main page click `Segments`.
2. Click `New Segment`.
3. Populate the details of the segment as shown.
4. Click `Create`.

!["Create Segment"](/images/02_create_segment-b276e53db39b863f719ae2daa2f8c940.png)

You should see the message `Segment created!`.

### Create a Constraint

Constraints are used to target a specific segment.

<Note>
  Constraints are not required to match a segment. A segment with no constraints
  will match every request by default.
</Note>

To create a constraint:

1. On the Segment Details page for the new segment you created, click
   `New Constraint`.
2. Populate the details of the constraint as shown.
3. Click `Add Constraint`.

!["Create Constraint"](/images/03_create_constraint-1c7f95f07e6e745d5bcca26afa4a371a.png)

You should see the message `Constraint added!`.

Click `Segments` in the navigation menu and you should now see your newly
created segment in the list.

## Rules and Distributions

Finally we'll create a rule and set of distributions for your flag and variants.
Rules and distributions allow you to define which variant gets returned when you
evaluate a specific flag that falls into a given segment.

To create a rule and distribution:

1. Go back to the flag you created at the beginning.
2. Click `Targeting`.
3. Click `New Rule`.
4. Under `Segment:` choose the segment you created earlier.
5. Under `Then serve:` choose `A Percentage Rollout`.
6. You should see your two variants that you created earlier, with a percentage
   of 50% each next to them.
7. Click `Add Rule`.

!["Create Rule"](/images/04_create_rule-a3ea6bb1f1ef526b80ae94370d924821.png)

You should see the message `Rule added!`. You just created your first rule and
distribution.

A distribution is a way of assigning a percentage for which entities evaluated
get a specific variant. The higher the percentage assigned, the more likely it
is that any entity will get that specific variant.

<Note>
  You could just as easily have picked a single variant instead of `A Percentage
  Rollout` when setting up your rule. This would effectively mean you have a
  single distribution, a variant with 100% chance of being returned.
</Note>

## Evaluation and Debug console

After creating the above flag, segment and targeting rule, you're now ready to
test how this would work in your application.

Fortunately the Flipt UI contains a Debug Console to allow you to experiment
with different evaluation requests to see how they would be evaluated.

The main ideas behind how evaluation works is described in more detail in the
[Concepts](/concepts) documentation.

To test evaluation:

1. Navigate to the `Targeting` section for your flag that you created above.
2. Scroll down to the `Debug Console` section and click into the left pane where
   you will see a JSON payload. This represents the body of the request that
   will be evaluated.
3. Notice the `flagKey` matches the `key` field of your flag.
4. Notice that `entityId` is pre-populated with a random UUID. This represents
   the ID that you would use to uniquely identify entities (ex: users) that you
   want to test against your flags.
5. Note that the `context` object is pre-populated as well. This corresponds to
   the properties that will be evaluated to determine if your request matches
   any constraints of your segments.
6. Update the `context` object as shown.
7. Click `Debug`.
8. Note the `Response` pane to the right has been populated with the evaluation
   response from the server, informing you that this request would match your
   segment that you created earlier, and return one of the variants defined.
9. Experiment with different values for the `context` and `entityId` fields.

!["Debug Console"](/images/05_debug_console-890c2a713fea07fb51d41c3f4c8f531e.png)

<Note>
  You can click `Reset` to populate a new example request in the `Request` pane.
  This will also generate a fresh UUID for the `entityId` field.
</Note>

That's it! You're now ready to integrate Flipt into your application and start
defining your own flags and segments that will enable you to seamlessly rollout
new features to your users while reducing risk.
