## What You'll Learn

In this guide, you will learn how to deploy Flipt to a local Kubernetes cluster (via [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)) using our official Helm chart. You'll also learn how to override the default Flipt configuration by providing a `values.yaml` file.

By the end of this guide, we will have:

- üö¢ Created a Kind cluster locally using Docker
- üì¶ Installed Flipt into your cluster via Helm
- ‚öôÔ∏è Configured Flipt log level and other settings via a `values.yaml` file

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed (Download: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- Helm v3.x installed (Installation guide: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- Kind installed (Installation guide: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)

## Deploying Flipt

### 1. Create a Local Kubernetes Cluster Using Kind

First, we need to create a local Kubernetes cluster. We'll use [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) to accomplish this.

Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
kind create cluster --name flipt
```

This command will create a new Kubernetes cluster named `flipt`. Wait for the command to complete and ensure the cluster is correctly set up.

### 2. Add the Flipt Helm Repository

Next, we'll add the [Flipt Helm repository](https://helm.flipt.io/) which hosts the Flipt Helm charts. Run the following command:

```bash
helm repo add flipt https://helm.flipt.io/
```

After running this command, Helm will fetch shared information about the new repository.

### 3. Update Helm Repositories

To ensure that Helm has the latest information about the charts from the Flipt Helm repository, update the repositories:

```bash
helm repo update
```

### 4. Install Flipt with Custom Configuration

Before installing Flipt, you should create a `values.yaml` file to customize the deployment according to your preferences. For example, to set a specific configuration value, you could add the following to your `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
flipt:
  config:
    log:
      level: WARN
    cache:
      enabled: true
      backend: memory
```

This example sets the Flipt server log level to 'WARN' and also enables our in-memory cache. You can adjust this file to include any configuration values you need.

Once you have your `values.yaml` file, you can use it when installing Flipt with Helm by using the `-f` or `--values` flag:

```bash
helm install flipt flipt/flipt -f values.yaml
```

This command installs the Flipt Helm chart into your Kubernetes cluster using the configuration options specified in your `values.yaml` file merged with the default values from Flipt.

<Note>
  The `values.yaml` file allows you to customize many aspects of the deployment,
  including resource limits and requests, service types, replica counts, and
  more. Be sure to consult the [Flipt
  documentation](https://www.flipt.io/docs/configuration/overview) and the
  default `values.yaml` in the Flipt Helm chart for more information on what can
  be configured.
</Note>

### 5. Forward the Port to Access Flipt

After successfully installing Flipt via the Helm chart, you should see instructions on how to access Flipt in your terminal. The instructions will look something like this:

```bash
You have successfully deployed Flipt.

  export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=flipt,app.kubernetes.io/instance=flipt" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  export CONTAINER_PORT=$(kubectl get pod --namespace default $POD_NAME -o jsonpath="{.spec.containers[0].ports[0].containerPort}")
  kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 8080:$CONTAINER_PORT
```

Execute the commands in your terminal to forward the port and access Flipt.

You should now be able to access Flipt at `http://localhost:8080`.

### 6. Verify the Installation and Configuration

To ensure that Flipt has been correctly deployed to your Kubernetes cluster, you can check the running pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

You should see the Flipt pod in the list with a status of `Running`.

```console
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
flipt-6d64f856d7-4l5qn       1/1     Running   0          32m
```

To verify that your configuration changes were applied, you can `curl` Flipt's `/meta/config` endpoint:

```bash
curl --silent http://localhost:8080/meta/config | jq
```

In the output of this command, you should see the configuration values you set in your `values.yaml` file.

```json
  "log": {
    "level": "WARN",
    ...
  },
  "cache": {
    "enabled": true,
    "backend": "memory",
    ...
  },
```

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed Flipt to a local Kubernetes cluster using our Helm chart. You've also learned how to override the default Flipt configuration by providing a `values.yaml` file.

You should be able to take the knowledge you've gained in this guide and deploy Flipt in to a real Kubernetes cluster.

Please refer to the [Flipt Helm chart repository](https://github.com/flipt-io/helm-charts) for more information on how to configure Flipt using the Helm chart.

Additionally, you should checkout our documentation on our native [Kubernetes authentication method](/authentication/methods#kubernetes).
This method can be leverage to automatically authenticate clients, without the need to manually manage credentials, for applications deployed into the same Kubernetes cluster as Flipt.
