description: Configuring Flipt to enable login with GitHub via OAuth2.0
---

If you've read the [Login With Google guide](/guides/login-with-google), you would have learned that Flipt supports many methods of authentication for users to control who has access to Flipt.

Alongside the support for generic OIDC login, Flipt has launched support for login with GitHub in version [v1.26.0](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/releases/tag/v1.26.0), through their OAuth2.0 flow. This guide will serve as a walk-through on how to set this flow up for users of Flipt in your organization.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)

## Brief on OAuth2.0

OAuth2.0 is an authentication standard whose goal is to allow 3rd party applications to access authorized resources from a provider. It relies on the user explicitly granting access to the 3rd party application to issue a token on behalf of the OAuth2.0 provider for authorized use.

In comparison to OIDC, OAuth2.0 doesn't have an identity standard, so retrieving identity can vary drastically from provider to provider. Therefore, it's up to the user to consult the OAuth2.0 provider's documentation to understand if and how identity information can be retrieved.

## Creating OAuth2.0 Application on GitHub

1. Navigate to your GitHub account, and click on `Settings` under the menu of your Profile icon

2. At the bottom of the menu on the left, click on the menu option titled `Developer Settings`

3. This should bring you to a page that has `OAuth Apps` as a menu option on the left, click on that and click `New OAuth App` to start creating the application

4. You should be brought to a page that looks like the image below, and can start filling out the information:

![OAuth2.0 App Creation](/images/guides/login-with-github/oauth-registration.png)

- `Application Name`: Give your application a meaningful name
- `Homepage URL`: Usually Flipt will be used internally by organizations, so this value depends on how you plan to expose Flipt. When in doubt you can just use the URL to your organization's home page
- `Authorization callback URL`: This value requires a publicly accessible endpoint on the internet. Thankfully, there are tools such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) that will allow public traffic to an application running locally. Since we will be running Flipt in a Docker container locally, you can fire up `ngrok` and point it to port 8080 on your local machine, with the following command:

```bash
$ ngrok http 8080
```

Copy the https URL that `ngrok` provides, and append `/auth/v1/method/github/callback` to it. This will be the value you should put for the callback URL. (e.g. `https://36f1-2600-1700-1d64-daa0-444c-3f7e-ceb7-3825.ngrok-free.app/auth/v1/method/github/callback`).

<Note>
  We're using `ngrok` here for illustration purposes. In a production setting,
  you would use whichever publically accessible domain name you have configured
  for your Flipt deployment. These values can always be changed later after the
  creation of the application.
</Note>

5. Retrieve the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from the created OAuth2.0 app

The Client ID should already be provided to you. You will have to generate a client secret. Click on the `Generate a new client secret` button (it might ask you to authenticate again with GitHub).

## Running Flipt Locally

1. Define a `config.yml`

Flipt relies on configuration that the user provides for many bits of functionality. In order to enable the Login With GitHub feature, you must define a configuration file `config.yml` with certain fields and values.

Our [documentation](https://www.flipt.io/docs/configuration/overview) gives a complete list of all configuration values available for how to configure Flipt.

The [Authentication Methods: GitHub](/configuration/overview#authentication-methods-github) section of our configuration documentation describes the values needed to enable the Login with GitHub functionality.

It should look similar to the following:

```yaml
version: "1.0"

log:
  level: DEBUG

authentication:
  required: true
  session:
    domain: ${REDIRECT_ADDRESS}
  methods:
    github:
      enabled: true
      client_id: ${CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${CLIENT_SECRET}
      redirect_address: ${REDIRECT_ADDRESS}
      scopes:
        - "user:email"
```

The `client_id` and `client_secret` are going to be the values from your GitHub OAuth application. The `redirect_address` will be the `ngrok` URL with no path (e.g. `https://36f1-2600-1700-1d64-daa0-444c-3f7e-ceb7-3825.ngrok-free.app`). The `scopes` are entirely dependent on what level of access you would like the returned GitHub access token to have. The [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps) describes a list of valid scopes.

The last bit of configuration is the session details. In order for the browser to establish a session to communicate with Flipt in an authenticated way, we must provide access details in an HTTP cookie whose value is a static token created by Flipt. This static token is created during the GitHub OAuth2.0 flow, and associated with the GitHub metadata retrieved from the GitHub API with the access token. The `domain` value will specify which host can receive the cookie. Since we only care about the host serving Flipt, you can provide the `ngrok` URL value but without the `https://` prefix (e.g. `36f1-2600-1700-1d64-daa0-444c-3f7e-ceb7-3825.ngrok-free.app`).

2. Run the Docker container

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v "$(pwd)/config.yml:/config.yml" \
  flipt/flipt:latest --config /config.yml
```

This will mount the `config.yml` as a volume in the container, and Flipt will use that configuration as it's provided as a command line flag option.

3. Login With GitHub

Access the front end by typing in the `ngrok` URL in the address bar of a browser. You should see the following screen:

![Login With GitHub](/images/guides/login-with-github/login-with-github.png)

Click the button to Login With GitHub, and it should take you to the GitHub domain to complete the authentication flow with the following screen:

![GitHub Authorization](/images/guides/login-with-github/github-authorization.png)

Click on the green `Authorize {username}` button to allow completion of the OAuth2.0 flow

4. âœ… Start using Flipt

After completion of the flow you should be taken to the normal Flipt homepage and start using Flipt normally as before. If you have a profile picture on GitHub, it should show in the top right corner.

## Conclusion

This guide shows the basics of getting Flipt running with GitHub OAuth2.0 authentication in a development setting using `ngrok`. Now that you know the basics, you can tailor the configuration pieces to fit your exact use cases. For instance, you probably would not use `ngrok` in a production setting, but rather a custom domain. If you have a custom domain, you can modify the `Authorization Callback URL` value on the GitHub OAuth application page, the `redirect_address`, and `domain` configuration values for the Flipt configuration.
