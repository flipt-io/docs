mode: "wide"
---

If you’re already a LaunchDarkly user, migrating from LaunchDarkly to Flipt is a simple, 4-step process.

We suggest you follow the steps one after the other, in the order they’re listed. This will allow you to rollback changes easily, in case of a migration error.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Migrating from LaunchDarkly SDK to OpenFeature SDK">
    First, we’ll identify all flag instances in your codebase, and migrate them
    from the traditional LaunchDarkly SDK to the OpenFeature SDK. This will
    enable us to make as little modifications as possible to your codebase, and
    allow you to replace feature flagging vendors with ease.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adding the Flipt OpenFeature Provider">
    Since Flipt supports OpenFeature, migrating to Flipt is as easy as changing
    the LaunchDarkly OpenFeature provider to the Flipt OpenFeature provider.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Installing Flipt">
    In order to use Flipt, you would need to install it in your infrastructure.
    If you want us to handle security and user management for you, you can
    choose to use our Hybrid Cloud offering in addition to installing your Flipt
    instance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Migrate State from LaunchDarkly to Flipt">
    The last part is to migrate all of your existing flags from the LaunchDarkly
    interface to your Flipt instance.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Flipt has a [new cloud offering](/cloud/overview) that allows you to run your
  own Flipt instance, without worrying about managing authentication and users.
  It has no limits - and we'll assist you in LaunchDarkly to Flipt migration
  services for free, for all of our paying users.
