## Pro Licensing

Pro features are protected by license key validation and cannot be accessed without a valid license. For detailed information about Pro features and purchasing options, see our [Flipt Pro](/v2/pro) page.

## SDK and Integration Licensing

**All Flipt SDKs and client libraries remain MIT licensed**, ensuring that:

- Your application code using Flipt SDKs has no licensing restrictions
- You can integrate Flipt into commercial applications freely
- There are no licensing concerns for end-user applications

This includes:

- All language-specific SDKs (Go, Python, Node.js, etc.)
- OpenFeature providers
- Integration libraries and tools

## Fair Core License

Flipt v2 is licensed under the [Fair Core License](https://fcl.dev/) (FCL).

The Fair Core License is a [Fair Source](https://fair.io/) license specifically designed for self-hosted software that balances developer sustainability with user freedom. It's a mostly-permissive non-compete license that eventually transitions to Open Source after 2 years.

### What the FCL Allows

Under the Fair Core License, you can:

- **Read, use, modify, and redistribute** the Flipt source code
- **Use Flipt for any purpose** that doesn't compete with Flipt's business interests
- **Self-host and deploy** Flipt in your infrastructure
- **Modify the code** to suit your needs

### What the FCL Restricts

The FCL restricts **competing uses**, which means you cannot:

- Create a competing cloud or SaaS offering using Flipt
- Offer Flipt as a managed service to third parties
- Remove or circumvent license checks for commercial features

### Transition to Open Source

After 2 years from each software version's release, that version automatically becomes available under an Open Source license (MIT), ensuring long-term access and community benefit.

## Why We Chose the Fair Core License

The Fair Core License allows us to:

- Share our entire codebase in a single repository under a single license
- Maintain sustainable development while keeping core functionality free
- Ensure all features eventually become Open Source
- Protect our ability to offer commercial services while respecting user freedom

## Important Restrictions

### License Compliance

When using Flipt v2, you **must not**:

- Remove or modify license checks in the source code
- Attempt to circumvent license protection mechanisms
- Distribute modified versions that bypass commercial feature restrictions
- Use Flipt to create competing feature flag services

### Commercial Use Guidelines

For most users and organizations, Flipt v2 can be used freely in commercial environments. The restrictions primarily apply to companies wanting to compete directly with Flipt's business model.
