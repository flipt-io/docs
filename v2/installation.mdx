Flipt v2 is a single binary that can be run on any Linux or macOS (arm64) host. You can install and try out Flipt v2 in a two different ways:

<CodeGroup>

```console Binary
curl -fsSL https://get.flipt.io/v2 | sh
```

```console Docker
docker run -d \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -p 9000:9000 \
    -v $HOME/flipt:/var/opt/flipt \
    docker.flipt.io/flipt/flipt:v2-beta
```

</CodeGroup>

For more details on each installation method, see the sections below.

- [Docker](#docker)
- [Binary](#binary)

<Info>
  Flipt v2 is currently in beta. Once we release a stable version, we'll update
  the installation instructions to include Helm, and Homebrew installation
  options.
</Info>

## Docker

Docker installation is required on the host, see the [official installation docs](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

<Note>
  Flipt requires Docker Engine version
  [20.10](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/20.10/) or higher.
</Note>

### Running

```console
docker run -d \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -p 9000:9000 \
    -v $HOME/flipt:/var/opt/flipt \
    docker.flipt.io/flipt/flipt:v2-beta
```

This will download the image and start a Flipt container and publish ports
needed to access the UI and backend server. All persistent Flipt data will be
stored in `$HOME/flipt`.

<Info>
  `$HOME/flipt` is just used as an example, you can use any directory you would
  like on the host.
</Info>

The Flipt container uses host-mounted volumes to persist data:

| Host location | Container location | Purpose                      |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| $HOME/flipt   | /var/opt/flipt     | For storing application data |

This allows data to persist between Docker container restarts.

<Warning>
  If you don't use mounted volumes to persist your data, your data will be lost
  when the container exits!
</Warning>

After starting the container you can visit [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080) to view the
application.

<Note>Flipt runs without the root user in the Docker container.</Note>

### Configuration

A default configuration file is included within the image. To supply a custom configuration, update the `docker run` command to mount your local configuration into the container:

```console
docker run -d \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -p 9000:9000 \
    -v $HOME/flipt:/var/opt/flipt \
    -v $HOME/flipt/config.yaml:/etc/flipt/config.yaml \
    docker.flipt.io/flipt/flipt:v2-beta
```

## Binary

You can always download the latest release archive of Flipt v2 from the
[Releases](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/releases) section on GitHub.

### Installing

You can use the following script to download and install the latest Flipt binary:

```console
curl -fsSL https://get.flipt.io/v2 | sh
```

This will install Flipt to `/usr/local/bin/flipt` on Mac and Linux systems.

View the [install.sh](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/blob/v2/install.sh) source for more details.

### Running

Run the Flipt server with:

```console
flipt server [--config OPTIONAL_PATH_TO_YOUR_CONFIG]
```

Flipt will check in a few different locations for server configuration (in order):

1. `--config` flag as an override
2. `{{ USER_CONFIG_DIR }}/flipt/config.yml` (the `USER_CONFIG_DIR` value is based on your architecture and specified in the [Go documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/os#UserConfigDir))
3. `/etc/flipt/config/default.yml`

See the [Configuration](/v2/configuration/overview) section for more details.

## Supported Architectures

Flipt v2 is built for the following architectures/os:

- **x86-64** / **Linux**
- **ARM64** / **Linux**
- **x86-64** / **Darwin/MacOS**
- **ARM64** / **Darwin/MacOS**

You can find the binaries for each architecture in the [Latest Release](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/releases/latest) assets section on GitHub.

The [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/flipt/flipt/tags) for Flipt v2 is multi-arch and supports both **x86-64** and **ARM64** architectures on **Linux**.

If you need a different architecture, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/issues) and we will try to accommodate your request.
