title: Flipt Cloud to Flipt v2
description: Learn how to migrate from Flipt Cloud to a self-hosted Flipt v2 instance
---

This guide will walk you through migrating from Flipt Cloud to a self-hosted Flipt v2 instance while preserving your existing feature flag data.

## Prerequisites

- An active [Flipt Cloud](https://flipt.cloud) account with configured environments
- A GitHub repository containing your feature flag data (managed by Flipt Cloud)
- [Flipt v2 installed](/v2/installation) on your target environment
- Access to the GitHub repository containing your feature flag data

## Migration Overview

Since Flipt Cloud already stores your feature flag data in Git repositories, migrating to Flipt v2 is straightforward. You'll configure Flipt v2 to sync with the same GitHub repository that Flipt Cloud has been using.

### 1. Identify Your Flipt Cloud Repository

First, identify the GitHub repository and configuration that Flipt Cloud is using for your environment:

1. Log into your [Flipt Cloud](https://flipt.cloud) dashboard
2. Navigate to your environment settings
3. Click on the **Integrations** tab
4. Click on the 'View GitHub Repository' button
5. Note the following information:
   - **Repository URL**: The GitHub repository where your flags are stored
   - **Branch**: The branch being used (typically `main`)
   - **Directory**: The directory path within the repository (if any)

### 2. Export Authorization Configuration

1. While logged into Flipt Cloud, click on the **Settings** tab
2. Click on the **Roles** tab
3. Click on the **Export RBAC** button
4. Download the authorization configuration archive and save it for later

### 3. Set Up GitHub Authentication

Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) that Flipt v2 can use to access your repository:

1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click **"Generate new token"**
3. Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "Flipt v2 Migration")
4. Select the appropriate resource owner and repositories
5. Set an expiration date
6. Select the following repository scopes:
   - `repo` read and write access (for private repositories)
   - `contents` read and write access
7. Click **"Generate token"** and copy the token

<Warning>
  Save your token securely. You will not be able to see it again after leaving
  this page.
</Warning>

### 4. Configure Flipt v2

Create or update your Flipt v2 configuration file to connect to your existing GitHub repository:

#### Add GitHub Credentials

```yaml
credentials:
  github:
    type: access_token
    access_token: ${env:GITHUB_TOKEN}
```

#### Configure Storage Backend

```yaml
storage:
  github:
    remote: "https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git"
    branch: "main"
    poll_interval: "30s"
    credentials: "github"
    backend:
      type: local
      path: "/tmp/flipt-repo"
```

Replace:

- `<your-username>` and `<your-repo>` with your actual GitHub repository details
- `branch` with the branch used by Flipt Cloud (if different from `main`)
- `path` with your preferred local storage location

#### Configure Environments

If you have multiple environments in Flipt Cloud, configure them in Flipt v2:

```yaml
environments:
  production:
    name: "Production"
    storage: "github"
    default: true
    directory: "production" # Use the same directory as Flipt Cloud
  staging:
    name: "Staging"
    storage: "github"
    directory: "staging" # Use the same directory as Flipt Cloud
```

<Note>
  Make sure the directory paths match exactly what Flipt Cloud was using to
  avoid data conflicts.
</Note>

#### Configure Authorization

If you have any custom RBAC roles or permissions in Flipt Cloud, you'll need to configure them in Flipt v2.

<Tip>
  If you don't have any custom RBAC roles or permissions in Flipt Cloud, you can
  skip this step.
</Tip>

Unarchive the authorization configuration from earlier and put the files somewhere accessible to Flipt v2.

Update the `policy.rego` file to have the package name `flipt.authz.v2` instead of `flipt.authz.v1`.

```rego policy.rego
package flipt.authz.v2

import rego.v1

default allow := false

allow if {
	some rule in has_rules

	permit_string(rule.resource, input.request.resource)
	permit_slice(rule.actions, input.request.action)
	permit_string(rule.namespace, input.request.namespace)
}
```

Update the `config.yaml` file to point to the new policy files:

```yaml
authorization:
  required: true
  local:
    policy:
      path: "policy.rego"
    data:
      path: "data.json"
```

See [Authorization](/v2/configuration/authorization) for more information.

### 5. Start Flipt v2

1. Set your GitHub token as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
   ```

2. Start Flipt v2 with your configuration:

   ```bash
   ./flipt server --config config.yaml
   ```

3. Flipt v2 will:
   - Clone your existing repository
   - Load your feature flag data
   - Begin syncing with GitHub

### 6. Verify Migration

1. Access the Flipt v2 UI (typically at `http://localhost:8080`)
2. Verify that all your feature flags, segments, and rules are present
3. Check that all environments are configured correctly
4. Test flag evaluation to ensure everything works as expected

### 7. Update Your Applications

Update your applications to point to your new Flipt v2 instance instead of Flipt Cloud:

1. **Update SDK Configuration**: Change the Flipt server URL in your application code
2. **Update API Keys**: Generate new [Static Tokens](/v2/configuration/authentication#static-token) in Flipt v2 if needed
3. **Test Evaluation**: Verify that flag evaluation works with your new instance

### 8. Decommission Flipt Cloud

Once you've verified that your migration is successful:

1. Update any remaining applications to use Flipt v2
2. When ready, you can delete your Flipt Cloud environment

### Data Continuity

Your feature flag data will remain intact throughout this migration because:

- Flipt Cloud stores data in your GitHub repository
- Flipt v2 reads from the same repository structure
- No data transformation or conversion is required
- All flag history is preserved in Git

### Troubleshooting

#### Repository Access Issues

If Flipt v2 cannot access your repository:

- Verify your GitHub token has the correct permissions
- Check that the repository URL is correct
- Ensure the branch name matches what Flipt Cloud was using
- Ensure the directory path matches what Flipt Cloud was using

#### Sync Issues

If changes aren't syncing properly:

- Check the `poll_interval` setting
- Verify write permissions on the local storage path
- Verify your GitHub token as the correct scopes (write access to the repository)
- Review Flipt v2 logs for sync errors

## Next Steps

After successful migration:

- [Configure authentication](/v2/guides/operations/authentication) for your team
- [Set up environments](/v2/configuration/environments) for your deployment pipeline
- [Review configuration settings](/v2/configuration/overview) for your deployment
- [Setup Merge Proposals](/v2/guides/user/environments/merge-proposals) for your environments
