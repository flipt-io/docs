## Telemetry

Flipt developers rely on anonymous usage data to help prioritize new features and improve the product. The information collected is completely anonymous,
never shared with external entities, and you can opt-out at any time.

The telemetry data is collected by default, but you can disable it by following the instructions below.

Telemetry is only collected when Flipt is running, **once at startup** and then every **4 hours**.

### What Kind of Data is Collected?

- Flipt version (i.e.: v2.0.0)
- Operating system (i.e.: Linux)
- Architecture (i.e.: amd64)

We use [Jitsu](https://jitsu.com/) to collect the data. Only the Flipt team has access to the raw data.

Here is an example of the telemetry data sent to Jitsu:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "uuid": "1545d8a8-7a66-4d8d-a158-0a1c576c68a6",
  "lastTimestamp": "2023-04-25T01:01:51Z",
  "flipt": {
    "version": "v2.0.0",
    "os": "linux",
    "arch": "amd64"
  }
}
```

You can always view the current schema of the telemetry data and see how it's collected on
[GitHub](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/blob/main/internal/telemetry/telemetry.go).

### How To Disable Telemetry

Telemetry collection can be disabled in several ways:

#### Configuration File

```yaml
meta:
  telemetry_enabled: false
```

#### Environment Variables

```shell
export FLIPT_META_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
```

Telemetry can also be disabled by setting the [DO_NOT_TRACK](https://consoledonottrack.com/) environment variable to `true` or `1`:

```shell
export DO_NOT_TRACK=true
```
