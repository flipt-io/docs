## Analytics

Flipt includes functionality for reporting analytical data to a configurable storage engine.

Currently, Flipt has support for collecting data into the following storage engines:

- [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/)
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)

The data that gets collected currently includes:

- Flag Evaluation Count

Once a storage engine is configured, these analytics are viewable in the UI allowing users to visualize up to 24 hours of data for each metric.

The image above shows the past 30 minutes of the flag `flag1` evaluation counts.

### Origin

Analytics are currently only collected as they pass through the evaluation server. This means that analytics will be captured if you are using the REST or GRPC APIs via one of our [Server SDKs](/v1/integration/server/rest) or [GRPC SDKs](/v1/integration/server/grpc) for evaluations.

We have plans to support collecting analytics for [Client-Side](/v1/integration/client) evaluations in the future.

## ClickHouse

You can use a self-hosted ClickHouse instance or a [managed instance](https://clickhouse.com/cloud/) to store your analytics data.

We highly **recommend** using a separate database for analytics produced by Flipt. This ensures that Flipt analytic data can be logically isolated from the rest of your Clickhouse data.

<Note>
  The analytics database must be created before Flipt will be able to write
  analytical data and run any migrations. See our
  [migration](/v1/configuration/storage#migrations) section for more info.
</Note>

To create a database for Flipt analytics, you can use the following SQL:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS flipt_analytics;
```

See the [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs) for more information on how to get started with ClickHouse.

### Configuration

To configure Flipt to use ClickHouse for analytics, you will need to add the following configuration to your `config.yml` file or environment variables:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Environment Variables">

    ```bash
    FLIPT_ANALYTICS_STORAGE_CLICKHOUSE_ENABLED=true
    FLIPT_ANALYTICS_STORAGE_CLICKHOUSE_URL=clickhouse://clickhouse:9000/flipt_analytics
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Configuration YAML">

    ```yaml
    analytics:
      storage:
        clickhouse:
          enabled: true
          url: clickhouse://clickhouse:9000/flipt_analytics
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Prometheus

You can use any [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) server to store your analytics data.

### Configuration

To configure Flipt to use Prometheus for analytics, you will need to add the following configuration to your `config.yml` file or environment variables:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Environment Variables">

    ```bash
    FLIPT_ANALYTICS_STORAGE_PROMETHEUS_ENABLED=true
    FLIPT_ANALYTICS_STORAGE_PROMETHEUS_URL=http://prometheus:9090
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Configuration YAML">

    ```yaml
    analytics:
      storage:
        prometheus:
          enabled: true
          url: http://prometheus:9090
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Custom Headers

You can also add custom headers to the Prometheus requests by setting the `analytics.storage.prometheus.headers` configuration property. This can be useful if you are using a proxy or need to add additional authentication headers.

```yaml
analytics:
  storage:
    prometheus:
      headers:
        "Authorization": "Bearer <token>"
```
