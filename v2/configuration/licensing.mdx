description: This document describes how to configure licensing for Flipt v2 and how it works.
---

Flipt v2 is licensed under the [Fair Core License](https://fcl.dev/) (FCL).

Most of the features in Flipt v2 are available in the free edition, however some features are only available after purchasing a commercial license.

See our [licensing](/v2/licensing) documentation for more information on the license and frequently asked questions.

## License Configuration

You can configure the license key in the Flipt v2 configuration file or via environment variables.

<Tabs>

  <Tab title="Configuration YAML">

    ```yaml
    license:
      key: "your-license-key"
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Environment Variables">

    ```bash
    FLIPT_LICENSE_KEY="your-license-key"
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  You'll need to restart your Flipt v2 instance for the license key to take
  effect.
</Note>

## Acquiring a License

You can get a 14 day trial license for the Pro edition via our [Flipt v2 Pro License](https://getflipt.co/pro) purchase page.

The license will be emailed to you after checkout. After the trial period, you will need to provide a payment method to continue using the Pro edition.

<Tip>
  You can also purchase a license by contacting us at
  [support@flipt.io](mailto:support@flipt.io).
</Tip>

### Trial Expiration

If you do not provide a payment method after the trial period, the license will expire and your Flipt v2 instance(s) will revert to the free edition.

This means that you will lose functionality such as [Merge Proposals](/v2/introduction#merge-proposals) and other paid features.

### License Renewal

Paid licenses will be renewed automatically on a monthly basis. You can cancel the subscription at any time.

<Warning>
  Cancellations take effect immediately and you will lose access to paid
  features. You will be prorated for the remaining time in your current billing
  cycle.
</Warning>

See our [licensing](/v2/licensing) documentation for more information on how to cancel your subscription.

## License Validation

Flipt v2 will validate the license key on startup. If the license key is invalid, Flipt v2 will start with paid features disabled.

You'll see a message in the logs indicating that the license key is invalid.

### Continuous Validation

Flipt v2 will continuously validate the license key every 12 hours.

This means that you will **need to have an active network connection from the Flipt v2 instance to the internet** to validate the license key.

<Note>
  We are working on a solution to allow for offline validation of the license
  key. If you have a specific use case that requires offline validation, please
  contact us at [support@flipt.io](mailto:support@flipt.io).
</Note>

### License Expiration

If the license key expires, the Flipt v2 instance will continue to run but will be unable to access paid features.
