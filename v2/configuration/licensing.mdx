---

Flipt v2 is licensed under the [Fair Core License](https://fcl.dev/) (FCL).

Most of the features in Flipt v2 are available in the free edition, however some features are only available after purchasing a commercial license.

See our [licensing](/v2/licensing) documentation for more information on the license and frequently asked questions.

## License Configuration

You can configure the license key in the Flipt v2 configuration file or via environment variables.

<Tabs>

  <Tab title="Configuration YAML">

    ```yaml
    license:
      key: "your-license-key"
      # Optional: Path to offline license file for annual licenses
      file: "/path/to/license.lic"
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Environment Variables">

    ```bash
    FLIPT_LICENSE_KEY="your-license-key"
    # Optional: Path to offline license file for annual licenses
    FLIPT_LICENSE_FILE="/path/to/license.lic"
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  You'll need to restart your Flipt v2 instance for the license key to take
  effect.
</Note>

## Acquiring a License

You can get a 14 day trial license for the Pro edition by purchasing a [monthly](https://getflipt.co/pro/monthly) license. Note that trials are only available for monthly licenses, not [annual](https://getflipt.co/pro/annual) licenses.

The license will be emailed to you after checkout. After the trial period, you will need to provide a payment method to continue using the Pro edition.

### License Types

Flipt v2 supports both **monthly** and **annual** commercial licenses:

- **Monthly licenses**: Require continuous internet connectivity for validation
- **Annual licenses**: Support offline validation using license files for air-gapped environments

<Tip>
  Choose [monthly](https://getflipt.co/pro/monthly) for standard subscription or
  [annual](https://getflipt.co/pro/annual) for offline validation support. You
  can also purchase a license by contacting us at
  [support@flipt.io](mailto:support@flipt.io).
</Tip>

### Trial Expiration

If you do not provide a payment method after the trial period, the license will expire and your Flipt v2 instance(s) will revert to the free edition.

This means that you will lose functionality such as [Merge Proposals](/v2/introduction#merge-proposals), [Commit Signing](/v2/configuration/commit-signing), and other paid features.

### License Renewal

Paid licenses will be renewed automatically based on your subscription type (monthly or annual). You can cancel the subscription at any time.

<Warning>
  Cancellations take effect immediately and you will lose access to paid
  features. You will be prorated for the remaining time in your current billing
  cycle.
</Warning>

See our [licensing](/v2/licensing) documentation for more information on how to cancel your subscription.

## License Validation

Flipt v2 will validate the license key on startup. If the license key is invalid, Flipt v2 will start with paid features disabled.

You'll see a message in the logs indicating that the license key is invalid.

### Continuous Validation

Flipt v2 will continuously validate the license key every 12 hours.

This means that you will **need to have an active network connection from the Flipt v2 instance to the internet** to validate the license key.

### Offline License Validation

For **annual license purchases**, Flipt v2 supports offline license validation using cryptographically signed license files. This allows you to run Flipt v2 in air-gapped environments without internet connectivity.

To use offline validation:

1. Purchase an annual license
2. Download the provided license file (.lic)
3. Configure the `file` path in your license configuration
4. Restart your Flipt v2 instance

<Note>
  Offline license validation is only available for annual license purchases.
  Monthly licenses require continuous internet connectivity for validation.
</Note>

### License Expiration

If the license key expires, the Flipt v2 instance will continue to run but will be unable to access paid features.
