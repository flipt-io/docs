description: GPG commit signing for enhanced security and change verification
---

Flipt v2 supports GPG commit signing to provide cryptographic verification of configuration changes. This feature ensures the authenticity and integrity of your feature flag modifications, creating a verifiable audit trail for compliance and security purposes.

<Info>
  Commit signing is available in Flipt Pro and requires secrets management to be
  configured for secure key storage.

## Why Use Commit Signing?

GPG commit signing provides several important benefits:

- **Authenticity Verification**: Prove who made configuration changes with cryptographic signatures
- **Integrity Assurance**: Detect if commits have been tampered with after creation
- **Compliance Support**: Meet regulatory requirements for change management and audit trails
- **Trust Enhancement**: Team members can verify the source of feature flag changes
- **Non-repudiation**: Prevent disputes about who made specific changes

## How It Works

When commit signing is enabled, Flipt automatically signs all commits to your flag configuration repository with a GPG key. These signatures can be verified by Git hosting services like GitHub, GitLab, and Gitea, displaying a "Verified" badge next to signed commits.

## Prerequisites

Before enabling commit signing, ensure you have:

1. **Secrets Management Configured**: GPG keys are stored securely using [secrets management](/v2/configuration/secrets)
2. **GPG Key Pair**: A valid GPG private/public key pair for signing
3. **Flipt Pro License**: Commit signing is a Pro feature

## GPG Key Setup

### Generate a New GPG Key

If you don't have a GPG key, create one specifically for Flipt:

```bash
# Generate a new GPG key
gpg --full-generate-key

# Select RSA and RSA (default)
# Choose 4096 bits for maximum security
# Set expiration (recommended: 2 years)
# Enter details:
#   Real name: Flipt Bot
#   Email: flipt@yourcompany.com
#   Comment: Flipt configuration signing
```

### Export the Private Key

Export your private key for storage in your secrets provider:

```bash
# Export private key (replace with your key ID)
gpg --export-secret-keys --armor flipt@yourcompany.com > flipt-signing-key.asc

# The key ID can be found with:
gpg --list-secret-keys flipt@yourcompany.com
```

### Store Key in Secrets Provider

Store the private key securely using your configured secrets provider:

**Vault Example:**

```bash
vault kv put secret/flipt/signing-key private_key=@flipt-signing-key.asc
```

**File Provider Example:**

```bash
cp flipt-signing-key.asc /etc/flipt/secrets/signing-key
```

### Upload Public Key

Upload the public key to your Git hosting service:

```bash
# Export public key
gpg --export --armor flipt@yourcompany.com > flipt-public-key.asc
```

Add this public key to:

- **GitHub**: Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New GPG key
- **GitLab**: User Settings → GPG Keys → Add key
- **Gitea**: Settings → SSH/GPG Keys → Add GPG Key

## Configuration

Configure commit signing in your Flipt configuration:

```yaml
storage:
  default:
    signature:
      enabled: true
      type: "gpg"
      key_ref:
        provider: "vault" # Your secrets provider
        path: "flipt/signing-key" # Path to private key in secrets
        key: "private_key" # Key name within the secret
      name: "Flipt Bot" # Signer name
      email: "flipt@yourcompany.com" # Signer email
      key_id: "flipt@yourcompany.com" # GPG key identifier
```

## Deployment Examples

### Docker with File Secrets

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  flipt:
    image: flipt/flipt:latest
    volumes:
      - ./secrets:/etc/flipt/secrets:ro
      - ./config.yml:/etc/flipt/config.yml:ro
    environment:
      - FLIPT_CONFIG_PATH=/etc/flipt/config.yml
```

```yaml
# config.yml
secrets:
  providers:
    file:
      enabled: true
      base_path: "/etc/flipt/secrets"

storage:
  default:
    signature:
      enabled: true
      key_ref:
        provider: "file"
        path: "signing-key"
      name: "Flipt Production"
      email: "flipt-prod@company.com"
      key_id: "flipt-prod@company.com"
```

### Kubernetes with Vault

```yaml
# deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: flipt
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: flipt
      containers:
        - name: flipt
          image: flipt/flipt:latest
          env:
            - name: FLIPT_CONFIG_PATH
              value: "/etc/flipt/config.yml"
          volumeMounts:
            - name: config
              mountPath: /etc/flipt/config.yml
              subPath: config.yml
      volumes:
        - name: config
          configMap:
            name: flipt-config
```

```yaml
# config.yml in ConfigMap
secrets:
  providers:
    vault:
      enabled: true
      address: "https://vault.company.com"
      auth_method: "kubernetes"
      role: "flipt"

storage:
  default:
    signature:
      enabled: true
      key_ref:
        provider: "vault"
        path: "flipt/signing-key"
        key: "private_key"
      name: "Flipt Kubernetes"
      email: "flipt-k8s@company.com"
      key_id: "ABCD1234567890EF"
```

## Verification

### Check Signed Commits

After enabling signing, verify that commits are being signed:

```bash
# Clone your flag repository
git clone https://github.com/company/flags.git
cd flags

# Check recent commits for signatures
git log --show-signature -5

# Look for GPG signature verification
git verify-commit HEAD
```

### GitHub Verification

On GitHub, signed commits will display:

- ✅ **Verified** badge next to the commit
- GPG key information when clicking the badge
- Signature details in the commit view

### Troubleshoot Verification

If commits aren't showing as verified:

1. **Check public key upload**: Ensure the public key is added to your Git hosting service
2. **Verify email match**: The email in the GPG key must match the configured email
3. **Confirm key validity**: Ensure the GPG key hasn't expired
4. **Check key ID**: Verify the key_id matches your actual GPG key

## Security Best Practices

### Key Management

- **Use dedicated keys**: Create separate GPG keys specifically for Flipt signing
- **Set expiration dates**: Configure key expiration (1-2 years recommended)
- **Regular rotation**: Rotate keys periodically and update your secrets provider
- **Secure storage**: Store private keys only in secure secret management systems

### Access Control

- **Limit access**: Restrict who can access signing keys in your secrets provider
- **Environment separation**: Use different keys for development, staging, and production
- **Audit access**: Monitor who accesses signing keys and when
- **Principle of least privilege**: Grant minimal necessary permissions

### Operational Security

- **Monitor signatures**: Regularly verify that commits are being signed correctly
- **Backup keys**: Securely backup your GPG keys with proper encryption
- **Revocation plan**: Have a process to revoke and replace compromised keys
- **Team training**: Ensure team members understand how to verify signatures

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Signing Failures**

```
Error: failed to sign commit: gpg key not found
```

- Verify the key exists in your secrets provider
- Check the key reference path and key name
- Ensure the secrets provider is accessible

**Invalid Signatures**

```
Warning: commit signature verification failed
```

- Confirm the public key is uploaded to your Git hosting service
- Verify the email in your GPG key matches the configured email
- Check that the GPG key hasn't expired

**Key Loading Errors**

```
Error: failed to load GPG private key
```

- Verify secrets provider connectivity
- Check authentication credentials for your secrets provider
- Ensure the private key is in valid ASCII armored format

**Permission Errors**

```
Error: insufficient permissions to access secret
```

- Verify Flipt has the necessary permissions in your secrets provider
- Check authentication method configuration
- Review access policies for the signing key secret

### Debug Configuration

Enable debug logging to troubleshoot signing issues:

```yaml
log:
  level: "debug"
```

This will show detailed information about:

- GPG key loading attempts
- Signature generation process
- Secrets provider interactions
- Authentication status

### Validation Commands

Test your configuration:

```bash
# Check if GPG key can be loaded
gpg --import /path/to/private-key.asc

# Verify key information
gpg --list-secret-keys your-email@company.com

# Test signing
echo "test" | gpg --armor --sign --default-key your-email@company.com
```
