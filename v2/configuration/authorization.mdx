description: This document describes how to configure Flipt v2's authorization mechanisms.
---

Flipt supports the ability to secure its core API routes by setting the `required` field to `true` on the `authorization` configuration object.

```yaml config.yaml
authorization:
  required: true
```

When authorization is set to `required`, the API will ensure valid credentials are present on all management API requests.

<Info>
Once authorization has been set to `required: true` all management API routes will require a valid authentication session as well.

The UI will require a session-compatible authentication method (e.g. [OIDC](/v2/authentication/methods#openid-connect)) to be enabled.

</Info>

See the [Authorization: Overview](/v2/authorization/overview) documentation for more details on Flipt's API authorization handling.

## Backends

Flipt uses [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) to enforce authorization policies. OPA is a general-purpose policy engine that can be used to enforce policies across the stack.

Flipt supports sourcing policies and external data from various backends. Currently, Flipt supports the following backends:

- [Local](#local)

## Local

Flipt supports loading policy and external data from the local filesystem.

### Policies

For configuring policies, the files must be valid [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/) files.

You can specify the path to the policy file in the `policy` object in the `authorization` configuration object.

```yaml
authorization:
  required: true
  local:
    policy:
      path: "policy.rego"
```

The policy **must** have the following package declaration:

```rego policy.rego
package flipt.authz.v1
```

You can learn more about policies in our [Authorization: Overview](/v2/authorization/overview#policies) documentation.

#### Polling Interval

Flipt will poll the policy file for changes at a regular interval. By default, Flipt will poll the policy file every 5 minutes. You can adjust this interval by setting the `poll_interval` field in the `policy` object.

```yaml
authorization:
  required: true
  local:
    policy:
      path: "policy.rego"
      poll_interval: "1m"
```

### External Data

In addition to policies that can be used to enforce authorization rules, Flipt also provides a way to pass external data to the policy evaluation from the local filesystem. These data objects **must be valid JSON objects**.

This can be done by setting the `data` object in the `authorization` configuration object.

```yaml
authorization:
  required: true
  local:
    policy:
      path: "policy.rego"
    data:
      path: "data.json"
```

You can learn more about using data with policies in our [Authorization: Overview](/authorization/overview#external-data) documentation.

#### Polling Interval

Like policies, Flipt will poll data files for changes at a regular interval. By default, Flipt will poll the data file every 30 seconds. You can adjust this interval by setting the `poll_interval` field in the `data` object.

```yaml
authorization:
  required: true
  local:
    data:
      path: "data.json"
      poll_interval: "1m"
```
