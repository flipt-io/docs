description: This document describes how to configure the storage backend mechanisms for Flipt v2.
---

Flipt v2 stores all of its resources in git repositories. This section describes how those git repositories are persisted and managed.

## Identifiers

Each storage backend has an identifier that is used to reference the storage backend in the configuration, such as when specifying the storage backend for an environment.

Identifiers can be any string value but must be unique. Flipt creates a `default` identifier and storage backend for you automatically if you don't specify one.

In the following example, we've defined two storage backends:

- `staging` is a local storage backend that will serve Flipt flag state from a local directory.
- `development` is a memory storage backend that will serve Flipt flag state from an in-memory store.

```yaml
storage:
  staging: # id
    name: "staging"
    backend:
      type: local
      path: "/path/to/staging/repository"
  development: # id
    name: "development"
    backend:
      type: memory
```

## Backends

Flipt v2 supports the following storage backends:

- [Local](#local)
- [Memory](#memory)

### Local

The purpose of this backend type is to support serving Flipt flag state directly from your local filesystem in a git repository.

This allows the the data to be persisted between server restarts.

Flipt will periodically rebuild its state from the local disk every 10 seconds.

```yaml
storage:
  backend:
    type: local
    path: "."
```

The above configuration will create a local storage backend with the identifier `default` and serve Flipt flag state from the current working directory.

### Memory

The purpose of this backend type is to support serving Flipt flag state from an in-memory store.

This is useful for development and testing purposes where you don't want to persist flag state to disk.

```yaml
storage:
  backend:
    type: memory
```

The above configuration will create a memory storage backend with the identifier `default` and serve Flipt flag state from an in-memory store.

## Git Remotes

Flipt v2 supports syncing flag state to and from a remote git repository.

```yaml
storage:
  staging:
    remote: "https://github.com/flipt-io/example.git"
    branch: "main"
    poll_interval: "30s"
    credentials: "github"
    backend:
      type: memory
```

This configuration will create a git storage backend with the identifier `staging` in memory and will sync flag state to and from the remote repository.

### Conflict Resolution

Conflicts can occur when syncing flag state to and from a remote repository. The conflict resolution strategy in Flipt v2 is currently rudimentary and we aim to improve this in future releases.

When syncing flag state to and from a remote repository, Flipt will behave as follows:

- Remote state is synced to the local storage backend using the configured `poll_interval`
- On writes to the Flipt server, the local storage backend will create a new commit and push it to the remote repository
- Flipt keeps track of the last commit hash for each storage backend
- If a write is made to a flag state file that has been modified since the last commit, Flipt will refuse to push the changes to the remote repository and will instead return an error
- If a write is made to a flag state file that has not been modified since the last commit, Flipt will push the changes to the remote repository

### Credentials

Credentials enable the ability to authenticate with remote repositories.

Supported authentication schemes are:

- `basic`
- `ssh`
- `access_token`

Credentials are configured using the `credentials` configuration section and use identifiers to reference the credentials in the configuration.

<Tip>
  This means that you can use the same credentials for multiple storage backends
  if needed.

#### Basic

Basic authentication is a username and password pair.

```yaml
credentials:
  github:
    type: basic
    basic:
      username: < username >
      password: < github-personal-access-token >
```

#### SSH

In order to configure a git remote with SSH, you will need to generate an SSH key-pair and configure your repository provider with the public key.

GitHub has some excellent documentation regarding how to generate and install your credentials [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

Once you have your private key credentials you will need to configure Flipt to use them.
This can be done via the `storage.git.authentication.ssh` configuration section:

```yaml
credentials:
  github:
    type: ssh
    ssh:
      user: git
      private_key_path: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
      private_key_bytes: <raw-key-bytes> # alternatively pass the raw bytes inline
```

<Warning>
  `insecure_ignore_host_key` is not encouraged for production use, and is
  `false` by default. Instead, you are advised to put the key fingerprint in the
  known hosts file where you are running Flipt. For example, for GitHub you can
  do `ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts` on the Flipt host.
</Warning>

#### Access Token

Access tokens are a type of credential that are used to authenticate with a remote repository. These can be used for any remote repository provider that supports access tokens such as GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, and Azure DevOps.

```yaml
credentials:
  github:
    type: access_token
    access_token: < github-access-token >
```
