title: Secrets Management
description: Secure external secret integration with file-based and external secret providers
---

Flipt v2 supports external secrets management, allowing you to store sensitive configuration data like API keys, tokens, and certificates outside of your main configuration files.

This enhances security by centralizing secret management and reducing the risk of accidentally exposing sensitive data.

## Why Use External Secrets?

Instead of storing sensitive values directly in Flipt configuration files, external secrets provide:

- **Enhanced Security**: Sensitive data is stored in dedicated secret management systems with proper access controls
- **Centralized Management**: All secrets managed in one place with audit trails and access policies
- **Environment Separation**: Different secrets for development, staging, and production environments
- **Rotation Support**: Easy secret rotation without updating configuration files (coming soon)
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions for who can access which secrets

## Supported Providers

Flipt supports multiple secret providers to fit different deployment scenarios:

<Tip>
  We're working on adding support for more secret providers, including AWS
  Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, and Google Cloud Secret Manager.

## Configuration Overview

Enable secrets management by configuring providers in your Flipt configuration:

```yaml
secrets:
  providers:
    # Multiple providers can be configured
    file:
      enabled: true
      base_path: "/etc/flipt/secrets"
    vault:
      enabled: true
      address: "https://vault.company.com"
      auth_method: "token"
```

## File Provider

The file provider is the simplest option, storing secrets in a JSON file in the configured directory.

### Configuration

```yaml
secrets:
  providers:
    file:
      enabled: true
      base_path: "/etc/flipt/secrets" # Default: /etc/flipt/secrets
```

### Usage

Create secret files in the configured directory:

```bash
# Create a JSON file for secrets
echo '{"data": {"api-key": "sk-1234567890abcdef"}}' > /etc/flipt/secrets/secrets.json
```

<Note>Ensure the JSON file is valid and the `data` key is present.</Note>

For secrets that would be invalid JSON such as those that container newlines you can either escape the newlines or base64 encode the secret.

```bash
echo "-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----\n\n-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----\n" | base64 -w 0 > /etc/flipt/secrets/gpg-key.asc
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "gpg-key": "{base64 encoded secret}"
  }
}
```

## HashiCorp Vault Provider

Vault provides enterprise-grade secret management with advanced features like dynamic secrets, encryption as a service, and detailed audit logs.

### Basic Configuration

```yaml
secrets:
  providers:
    vault:
      enabled: true
      address: "https://vault.company.com"
      auth_method: "token"
      token: "hvs.your_vault_token"
      mount: "secret" # Default: secret
```

### Authentication Methods

#### Token Authentication

Best for development and testing:

```yaml
vault:
  enabled: true
  address: "https://vault.company.com"
  auth_method: "token"
  token: "hvs.your_vault_token"
```

#### Kubernetes Authentication

Ideal for Kubernetes deployments:

```yaml
vault:
  enabled: true
  address: "https://vault.company.com"
  auth_method: "kubernetes"
  role: "flipt-role"
  mount: "secret"
```

#### AppRole Authentication

Good for automated systems and CI/CD:

```yaml
vault:
  enabled: true
  address: "https://vault.company.com"
  auth_method: "approle"
  role: "flipt-role"
  mount: "secret"
```

### Environment Variables

Avoid storing sensitive values in configuration files by using environment variables:

```bash
export FLIPT_SECRETS_PROVIDERS_VAULT_TOKEN="hvs.your_vault_token"
export FLIPT_SECRETS_PROVIDERS_VAULT_ROLE_ID="your_role_id"
export FLIPT_SECRETS_PROVIDERS_VAULT_SECRET_ID="your_secret_id"
```

## Using Secrets

<Note>
  Currently, secrets can only be used with our [Commit
  Signing](/v2/configuration/commit-signing) feature. We are working on adding
  support for secrets in general configuration.
