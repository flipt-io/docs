## Configuration File

The default way that Flipt is configured is with the use of a configuration file
[default.yml](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/blob/main/config/default.yml).

This file is read when Flipt starts up and configures several important
properties for the server.

<Tip>
  We have both a [JSON
  schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flipt-io/flipt/main/config/flipt.schema.json)
  and a [Cue
  schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flipt-io/flipt/main/config/flipt.schema.cue)
  that you can use to validate your configuration file and it's properties.
</Tip>

You can edit any of these properties to your liking, and on restart Flipt will
pick up the new changes.

<Note>
  These defaults are commented out in
  [default.yml](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/blob/main/config/default.yml)
  to give you an idea of what they are. To change them you'll first need to
  uncomment them.
</Note>

These properties are as follows:

## Deprecations

From time to time configuration options will need to be deprecated and
eventually removed. Deprecated configuration options will be removed after \~6
months from the time they were deprecated.

All deprecated configuration options will be removed from the documentation,
however they will still work as expected until they are removed. A warning will
be logged in the Flipt logs when a deprecated configuration option is used.

All deprecated options are listed in the
[DEPRECATIONS](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/blob/main/DEPRECATIONS.md) file
in the Flipt repository as well as the
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Environment Variables

All options in the configuration file can be overridden using environment
variables using the syntax:

```yaml
FLIPT_<SectionName>_<KeyName>
```

<Note>
  Using environment variables to override defaults is especially helpful when
  running with Docker as described in the [Installation](/installation)
  documentation.
</Note>

Everything should be upper case, `.` should be replaced by `_`. For example,
given these configuration settings:

```yaml
server:
  grpc_port: 9000

db:
  url: file:/var/opt/flipt/flipt.db
```

You can override them using:

```yaml
export FLIPT_SERVER_GRPC_PORT=9001 export
FLIPT_DB_URL="postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/flipt?sslmode=disable"
```

## Databases

Flipt supports [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html),
[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/),
[CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) and
[MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/) databases.

SQLite is enabled by default for simplicity, however you should use Postgres,
MySQL, or CockroachDB if you intend to run multiple copies of Flipt in a high
availability configuration.

The database connection can be configured as follows:

### SQLite

```yaml
db:
  # file: informs flipt to use SQLite
  url: file:/var/opt/flipt/flipt.db
```

### Postgres

```yaml
db:
  url: postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/flipt?sslmode=disable
```

<Note>
  The Postgres database must exist and be up and running before Flipt will be
  able to connect to it.
</Note>

### CockroachDB

```yaml
db:
  url: cockroach://root@localhost:26257/flipt?sslmode=disable
```

<Note>
  The CockroachDB database must exist and be up and running before Flipt will be
  able to connect to it.
</Note>

### MySQL

```yaml
db:
  url: mysql://mysql@localhost:3306/flipt
```

<Note>
  The MySQL database must exist and be up and running before Flipt will be able
  to connect to it.
</Note>

### Migrations

From time to time the Flipt database must be updated with new schema. To
accomplish this, Flipt includes a `migrate` command that will run any pending
database migrations for you.

If Flipt is started and there are pending migrations, you will see the following
error in the console:

```yaml
migrations pending, please backup your database and run `flipt migrate`
```

If it is your first run of Flipt, all migrations will automatically be run
before starting the Flipt server.

<Warning>
  You should backup your database before running `flipt migrate` to ensure that
  no data is lost if an error occurs during migration.
</Warning>

If running Flipt via Docker, you can run the migrations in a separate container
before starting Flipt by running:

```yaml
docker run -it flipt/flipt:latest /bin/sh -c './flipt migrate'
```

## Import/Export

Flipt supports importing and exporting your feature flag data since
[v0.13.0](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/releases/tag/v0.13.0).

### Import

To import previously exported Flipt data, use the `flipt import` command. You
can import either from a file or from STDIN.

To import from STDIN, Flipt requires the `--stdin` flag:

```yaml
cat flipt.yaml | flipt import --stdin
```

If not importing using `--stdin`, Flipt requires the file to be imported as an
argument:

```yaml
flipt import flipt.yaml
```

This command supports the `--drop` flag that will drop all of the data in your
Flipt database tables before importing. This is to ensure that no data
collisions occur during the import.

<Warning>
  Be careful when using the `--drop` flag as it will immediately drop all of
  your data and there is no undo. It is recommend to first backup you database
  before running this command just to be safe.
</Warning>

### Export

To export Flipt data, use the `flipt export` command.

By default, `export` will output to STDOUT:

```yaml
$ flipt export

flags:
- key: new-contact-page
  name: New Contact Page
  description: Show users our Beta contact page
  enabled: true
  variants:
  - key: blue
    name: Blue
  - key: green
    name: Green

```

You can also export to a file using the `-o filename` or `--output filename`
flags:

```yaml
flipt export -o flipt.yaml
```

## Caching

Flipt supports both in-memory cache as well as Redis to enable faster reads and
evaluations. Enabling caching has been shown to speed up read performance by
several orders of magnitude.

<Warning>
  Enabling in-memory caching when running more than one instance of Flipt is not
  advised as it may lead to unpredictable results. It is recommened to use Redis
  instead if you are running more than one instance of Flipt.
</Warning>

Caching works as follows:

- All flag reads and evaluation requests go through the cache
- Flag cache entries are purged whenever a write to a flag or it's variants
  occur or the TTL expires
- Evaluation cache entries are purged after the TTL expires only
- A cache miss will fetch the item from the database and add the item to the
  cache for the next read
- A cache hit will simply return the item from the cache, not interacting with
  the database

See the [Cache](#cache) section for how to configure caching.

### Expiration/Eviction

You can also configure an optional duration at which items in the cache are
marked as expired.

For example, if you set the cache TTL to `5m`, items that have been in the cache
for longer than 5 minutes will be marked as expired, meaning the next read for
that item will hit the database.

Setting an eviction interval (in-memory cache only) will automatically remove
expired items from your cache at a defined period.

<Note>
  The combination of cache expiration and eviction can help lessen the amount of
  memory your cache uses, as infrequently accessed items will be removed over
  time.
</Note>

To tune the expiration and eviction interval of the cache set the following in
your config:

```yaml
cache:
  enabled: true
  backend: memory
  ttl: 5m # items older than 5 minutes will be marked as expired
  memory:
    eviction_interval: 2m # expired items will be evicted from the cache every 2 minutes
```

## Telemetry

Flipt developers rely on anonymous usage data to help prioritize new features
and improve the product. The information collected is completely anonymous,
never shared with external entities, and you can opt out at any time.

### What Kind of Data is Collected?

- Flipt version

You can view the full schema of the telemetry data on
[GitHub](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/blob/05b85f6ec704d9eac850984c16d9bc3d15dbdb6c/internal/telemetry/telemetry.go#L26-L30).

We use [Segment](https://segment.com) to collect the data. Only the creator of
Flipt has access to the data.

### How to Disable Telemetry

There are multiple ways in which you can disable telemetry collection:

#### Configuration File

```yaml
meta:
  telemetry_enabled: false
```

#### Environment Variable

```yaml
export FLIPT_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
```

## Metrics

Flipt exposes [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics at the `/metrics`
HTTP endpoint. To see which metrics are currently supported, point your browser
to `FLIPT_HOST/metrics` (ex: `localhost:8080/metrics`).

You should see a bunch of metrics being recorded such as:

```yaml
flipt_cache_hit_total{cache="memory",type="flag"} 1
flipt_cache_miss_total{cache="memory",type="flag"} 1
---
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0"} 8.641e-06
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.25"} 2.499e-05
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.5"} 3.5359e-05
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.75"} 6.6594e-05
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="1"} 0.00026651 go_gc_duration_seconds_sum
0.000402094 go_gc_duration_seconds_count 5
```

There is an
[example](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/tree/main/examples/prometheus)
provided in the GitHub repository showing how to setup Flipt with Prometheus.

### Dashboards

![Grafana Dashboard](/images/grafana_flag_dashboard.png)

We have created a set of [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboards that you can use to visualize the metrics collected by Flipt, including both server health and flag evaluation metrics.

You can find the dashboards in our [grafana-dashboards](https://github.com/flipt-io/grafana-dashboards) repository.

## Tracing

Flipt supports distributed tracing via the
[OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/) protocol and
[Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) library. Enable tracing via the
configuration values described above and point Flipt to your Jaeger host to
record spans.

There is an
[example](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/tree/main/examples/tracing) provided
in the GitHub repository showing how to setup Flipt with Jaeger.

## Authentication

<Warning>
Once authentication has been set to `required: true` all API routes will
require a client token be presented.

Browser sessions (UI) will require a session compatible authentication method be enabled.

Session compatible authentication methods are **not** yet supported, meaning that authentication
renders the UI unusable and Flipt is purely API driven.

Implementation of this feature is in the pipeline and scheduled for an upcoming release.

</Warning>

Flipt supports the ability to secure its core API routes by setting the `required` field to `true` on the `authentication` configuration object.
Once enabled, all API routes will require a [client token](./authentication#client-token) be presented in-order to authenticate the request.

```yaml
authentication:
  required: true
```

When authentication is set to `required`, the API will ensure valid credentials are present on all API requests.

See the [Authentication](./authentication) documentation for more details on Flipt's API authentication handling.

### Authentication Methods

Beneath the `authentication` section of the configuration file is the `methods` section.
Each key beneath this section is a particular authentication method.
These methods are disabled (`enabled: false`) by default.
Enabling and configuring a method allows for different ways to establish client token credentials within Flipt.

#### Cleanup

Each authentication method contains a nested `cleanup` configuration object.
This object configures the periodic deletion of _expired_ authentications created with the associated method.

```yaml
authentication:
  <method>:
    cleanup:
      interval: 10m
      grace_period: 24h
```

The cleanup object currently contains two keys `interval` and `grace_period`.
The `interval` is used to configured how frequently a delete _expired_ tokens is performed.
Whereas, `grace_period` is used to ensure that _expired_ tokens are preserved for at-least this configured duration.

This allows you to keep authentications around for auditing purposes after expiration.
Expired tokens are instances where the `expires_at` timestamp occurs before the current time.
The grace period is added onto this timestamp as a predicated, when the delete operation is made.

Tokens, when presented as a credential to the API, which have expired (`expires_at` is before `now()`) will begin immediately failing authentication.
The `grace_period` is simply for the cleanup process.

#### Token

This core and first method within Flipt is known as `token`.
The `token` method provides the ability to create client tokens statically, with optional expiry constraints.

```yaml
authentication:
  methods:
    token:
      enabled: true
```

### Reverse-proxy

It is possible to secure Flipt simply by running it behind a reverse-proxy in your own trusted environment.
An example of this can be found in the core Flipt repository [here](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/tree/main/examples/auth).

## Authorization

Currently, Flipt only supports authentication without any extended authorization capabilities.
Authorization is something we're actively exploring and we will update this section as we settle on a design.

We would appreciate your input into designing authorization. Head over to [our discord](https://flipt.io/discord) and let us know what you need from Flipt.
